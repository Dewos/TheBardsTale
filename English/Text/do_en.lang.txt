[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[E2-00] "Quest Complete!"
[FE-00] "You should just stay in here and get drunk with us my friend.  The whole town is going to hell in a basket, so what the hell are we gonna need a liver for?"
[EC-01] "Care to make a donation my son?"
[E2-05] "The Bard came out of the North towards Dounby, unable to shake the eerie feeling that he was being watched."
[E3-05] "You've come out of the north?"
[E4-05] "Aye."
[E5-05] "Not many do.  How is it you've come through the mountains unscathed?"
[E6-05] "I don't see how that's any business of yours."
[E7-05] "Just passing the time friend, no need to bristle. There isn't much work for us these days.  Not since those thrice damned Druids took over the city."
[E8-05] "Druids eh?  When did this happen?"
[E9-05] "The Bard ventured into the Lion's Den, unable to shake the eerie feeling that he was being watched."
[EA-05] "It's true then."
[EB-05] "I don't know what game he plays by coming here but he will regret it. Allow him to pass through the northern gate unmolested. When he's inside the city we will strike."
[EC-05] "There he is brothers! Kill him!"
[ED-05] "I see you Bard!"
[EE-05] "Brothers the Bard is over here!"
[EF-05] "Those Druids used to keep to themselves but several days ago they streamed out of the tower and started taking over. Now they're all over the city looking for someone."
[F0-05] "Agh stay away! I didn't do anything! Oh wait I thought you were one of those Druids."
[F1-05] "I hear the town of Kirkwall was completely destroyed by a horrific monster."
[F2-05] "We live in dark times my friend, rumor has it that even the dead are rising from their graves."
[F3-05] "Things are getting dangerous around here. I've been thinking of going over to O'dell's and getting myself a sword."
[F4-05] "Don't worry too much about all of the recent troubles, some tall, muscular, courageous hero will save the day. Let me know if you see someone like that around."
[F5-05] "You'd do best to avoid the Aiken Drum, I hear it's a wretched bar full of scum and villainy."
[F6-05] "I haven't slept well at all lately I have this huge boil right on my... wait didn't you want to hear about it?"
[F7-05] "I came here because I needed a change but now I wish I'd stayed in Stromness."
[F8-05] "Crossing through the occupied city the Bard eventually found his way to the local pub, which somehow he always seemed to do. The Aiken Drum was the popular hangout of drunks, the unemployed, and reprobates who made their living on the streets.  The Bard of course felt right at home."
[F9-05] "Welcome, friend.  I'd heard ye'd come to Dounby. Many in the city have, it's been many a winter since a man's come out of the north on his own two feet, and not in a pine box."
[FA-05] "I noticed that I seem to be quite popular with the locals."
[FB-05] "Aye the Princess knew ye'd have to pass through here on your way to your next stop so she had me waiting in this god forsaken city to lend you a helping hand."
[FC-05] "You've been a great help so far let me tell you."
[FD-05] "Nobody likes a smart ass son, I couldn't have helped ye get past them patrols. Those Druids have been tearing the city apart looking for you, they'd like nothing better than to stop you from freeing our lady, they'd have done for me easily."
[FE-05] "Of course, of course. Well, then what help can you actually lend me?"
[FF-05] "I can help you out with a bit o' information. There's a man lives west of here, goes by the name of MacRath. He's the caretaker of the Shadow Axe, and you'll need it to get into the next tower."
[00-06] "Yeah, yeah, as soon as I rescue his cat or steal him a gem or find his long lost betrothed. I get the drill. Everyone wants a piece of the Bard."
[01-06] "Ach, it's a cynical man ye are, but maybe that's what's kept you alive this long. MacRath is one of us lad, he's keeping the axe for you, all you have to do is go get it from him."
[02-06] "Don't suppose you could have had it waiting here for me?"
[03-06] "And risk it fallin into the hands of these Druids? That would truly be daft of us, it's a big enough risk I take meeting you here. Use your head for thinking and not just yapping."
[04-06] "That actually makes sense, but I can do without the lip. Remember, I'm your savior."
[05-06] "Get yer arse out of here and head to Greenlands to find MacRath."
[06-06] "Having a problem leaving town my lad?"
[07-06] "There are a lot of Druids out there and none of them are raising a glass to my health, I can tell you."
[08-06] "There might be another way out, there're tunnels under the city that used to lead outside. The entrances to the tunnels are scattered throughout Dounby"
[09-06] "And the catch is..."
[0A-06] "Well the tunnels are overrun with monsters."
[0B-06] "And that's supposed to be a better way out?"
[0C-06] "Never said it was better. Just said it was another way to go."
[0D-06] "I'm beginning to think you're tryin to kill me Dugan."
[0E-06] "Me? Why o' course not I'm yer best friend, probably yer only friend the way you treat folks."
[0F-06] "You've got to help me here. I can't understand a bleedin' word he's saying. Is this even MacRath?"
[10-06] "What do you mean? Of course that's MacRath."
[11-06] "Ask him a question."
[12-06] "Hello there old friend how are you gettin' along with this young scamp?"
[13-06] "Och braw dugan braw tae see ye an aw. thes bonnie lad haur saved mah hide frae tha nuckelavee 'at some trosk released."
[14-06] "Ah he's speaking in a rare Scottish tongue. I forgot that most people these days don't know it. Fortunately I do."
[15-06] "What's he on about?"
[16-06] "So far just that he's grateful for being rescued from the monster that some idiot released. But I'll get more information."
[17-06] "Teel me mair, whit happened?"
[18-06] "It was gantin'; tha undeid rose frae tha grae an' overtook mah castle. Ah fled only tae be attacked by 'at hideoos creature, but Ah hud tae lae behin' tha axe."
[19-06] "Ominous indeed."
[1A-06] "Teel yer mukker haur 'at if he'll help me tak' back mah castle, he can retrieve tha shadaw ax."
[1B-06] "Ooooooooh. You'll like that."
[1C-06] "What?"
[1D-06] "Whit will he huv tae div?"
[1E-06] "Tak' me back tae tha ruins ay mah castle an' i'll shaw heem tha entrance.  There's a trap duir leadin' doon intae tha dungeons but i've got tha key."
[1F-06] "Clever!"
[20-06] "Come again?"
[21-06] "Aam certain he'll help."
[22-06] "If 'e tinnie get through doz dungeons intact i'd say us princess 'as 'erself a worthy champion. O' cose ay wouldn't bet ed 'im mak'n it out, ay yew se this is de rite git?"
[23-06] "Ay thought de same th'n myself fe a blind bit, but ay am pretty certain."
[24-06] "All right.  That's it, that's it.  What are you two on about?"
[25-06] "Right, here's the deal. MacRath's going to take you to his castle...well the ruins of it at least."
[26-06] "Only if he buys me dinner first."
[27-06] "Where he'll open up a trapdoor that leads down into the dungeons."
[28-06] "What's inside?"
[29-06] "The Shadow Axe, like I told you before he was holding it for you. He had to leave it in his dungeon when all the trouble started. I've instructed him to take you to it."
[2A-06] "Now we're talking. What else?"
[2B-06] "Oh, just some undead warriors.  Now, once you have the shadow ax, you'll journey south along the coast..."
[2C-06] "Wait a moment. Undead warriors? How many?"
[2D-06] "A few. A score."
[2E-06] "Well which is it? A few or a score? It's a big difference you know."
[2F-06] "A few score. And when they're all dead, you'll head south to the coast, the third tower is located on a small island just offshore. You should have no trouble securing passage to the tower. Right, I'm off. It's getting dangerous around here."
[30-06] "Well?  Anything to say?"
[31-06] "I'll gi' ye' mine Shadah Hax, but guide it cannie, aye?"
[32-06] "Sorry I asked."
[33-06] "Right, what'll you have, Bard?"
[34-06] "What've you got?"
[35-06] "Well we've got Pig's Meade, Bodb's Black Ale, Bugbear's Light Brew or Captain Fargo's Single Cask Very Special Private Reserve."
[36-06] "Ah, the ale.  An effervescent start, with oaky overtones and a crisp finish with a peppery aftertaste.  Goes down smooth an' burns like hell on the way back up."
[38-06] "The Pig's Meade?  Better steer clear o' that.  It's mostly pond scum and fermented swine's vomit.  Not so much for drinkin' as knockin' a man cold before you sell 'im to the slavers."
[39-06] "Captain Fargo's Private Reserve? You must be a man of taste. It's our finest apples and honey, fermented and aged in port-wine barrels till it's mellow to the taste and warmin' to the heart."
[3A-06] "Care for another?"
[3B-06] "Did you hear!?  The Druids are looking for some kind of criminal, they've been tearing the town apart!"
[3C-06] "BELCH! Mmm.  Tastes like haggis!"
[3D-06] "I must've met a dozen Chosen Ones on me way here, an' every one of 'em a dangerous fool; steer clear of 'em if ye can, friend."
[3E-06] "I knew we should have done our rituals this year, our crops are ruined."
[3F-06] "Hallelujah, friend!  Me uncle's hanged himself an' left me everythin'!  Here's some silver for ya."
[40-06] "Move aside, friend. I've got money to spend."
[41-06] "The Nuckelavee's been seen near Dounby. Rumor is some fool let it loose!"
[42-06] "That's a fine-looking animal you've got. I know a restaurant that'd buy him in a Dounby minute if you'd a mind to sellin' him."
[43-06] "Step right up and show em what you got! How about entering our little contest and showing off your talents, the prize is well worth the effort."
[44-06] "And coming to you from the far reaches of Houton... the BARD!!!!!"
[45-06] "And you folks thought the Jugglers were bad!"
[46-06] "The bard quickly learned you can fool some of the people some of the time, but then again, not all people are incredibly stupid."
[47-06] "We have a winner!!!!"
[48-06] "Once again, the Bard proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had talent. Of course for someone trying to keep a low profile, entering a contest may not have been the brightest of ideas."
[49-06] "Well, well, it really was the Bard in that contest. Get him brothers!"
[4A-06] "Eeeeek! A rat! A rat! Get it away! Get it away!"
[4B-06] "Have no fear lass the rat is gone, slain by my magic!"
[4C-06] "Ooooh, well you're a heroic fellow, my thanks for your help. Here, tis not much but you did me quite a service in getting rid o' that rat."
[4D-06] "Got a crime to report, fill out the parchment. In triplicate.  If it's a missing person, forget it. People come to Dounby to get lost, not to be found. In fact, I can't really help you with much of anything.  Those druids are the real law around here."
[4E-06] "I've nothing to report; I'm just passing through town."
[4F-06] "Good luck on that. A lot of folks trying to pass through and not many succeeding... say you want to see something funny?"
[50-06] "Why not? I could use a laugh right about now."
[51-06] "Hey!  Which one of you sorry low-lifes is the chosen one?"
[52-06] "I am!  I'm the Chosen One!"
[53-06] "No! I'm the Chosen one!  I must fulfill my destiny!"
[54-06] "No he's not!  I'm the Chosen One!  I will save the world!"
[55-06] "That cracks me up every time. They come to town, talkin' crazy, takin' on monsters twice their size. Got so bad, I had to lock em up for their own safety. Say, you aren't one of these chosen ones are you?"
[56-06] "Oh, no! Not me. I'm all about wine, women, and song. Pretty much in that order. Wait, make that women, wine, and song."
[57-06] "Well look here, boyo. You just stay clear o' trouble."
[58-06] "If you have nothing to report, you'll need to go. And if you do... well it doesn't really matter."
[59-06] "Hey. You buyin'?"
[5A-06] "You buyin'? Great. Now I can show my old man I can run things. I mean, it's not my fault it takes me a while to figure things out. He's the one who dropped me on my head."
[5B-06] "That's a dirk. It's made out of silver. Which is kinda like gold, it's more silvery. You know?"
[5C-06] "Huh. Good choice."
[5D-06] "Hmmm I don't know I think its supposed ta be fast or something."
[5E-06] "Wow. Hope you like it."
[5F-06] "A flail. I like flails. That one's made outta some kind of special ummm... what was I talking about?"
[60-06] "Aw, you bought the flail? Now what am I gonna play with?"
[61-06] "A Lochabuy Axe I think that's what it is, it's named after the Baker down the street I think his name is Lockerby."
[62-06] "Good choice, mister. If you go sailing you could even use it for an anchor."
[63-06] "Wait. It'll come to me... A shortbow. No. A longbow. A Darkbarb longbow.  No, wait.  Blackthing bow...  a bow. Yeah.  A bow, that's it."
[64-06] "Hey. Careful where you point that thing."
[65-06] "That's a...um...a greatbow.  I mean, that's its' name.  I guess it's great, but I'm not s'posed to play with the weapons."
[66-06] "You know, if you pluck the string just right, you can play a little song."
[67-06] "I think that's an Elderwood Bow. Yah that's what I think... was I right?"
[68-06] "You know there's a factory rebate on that? One firbolg scalp and a proof-of-purchase seal and they'll send you two whole silvers!"
[69-06] "Leather armor. Leather armor smells nice."
[6A-06] "Try it on. There's a changing room in the back."
[6B-06] "Studly leather armor. I saw my mum wear it once, but I don't want to talk about that."
[6C-06] "Good choice. 'Course, my mum's gonna be upset."
[6D-06] "Dunno why they call it chain mail. I tried to send some to my friends in Kirkwall, but the postman wouldn't take it."
[6E-06] "Good choice! And the best part?  If you jump up and down real fast it jingles."
[6F-06] "Scale mail! Reminds me of a fish, you know?  My old man said anytime I wanted I could put it on and go swimming!"
[70-06] "Hey. I know. I'll put the other suit on and we can go jump in the lake!"
[71-06] "A Targ Shield. If you put it upside down on the ground, you can spin round really, really fast. 'Course you might get sick. I did."
[72-06] "You know, if you get bored, you can always use it as a dart board."
[73-06] "Kite shield!  I pulled it for ten miles and never even got it in the air!"
[74-06] "If you're gonna use that, just make sure the wind's really, really blowing."
[75-06] "You there! What do you want!?  You're him!  You're the Bard!  The Bard's at the gate!  Call out the brothers!"
[76-06] "The Bard had no option but to heed the warning before him.  Magic had no power here, so he would have to survive by his wits alone. May he rest in peace."
[77-06] "Careful friend, and be thou wary Of tricks and traps and beasties hairy. For in the chamber round the bend awaits a task, twill be thine end if too long you wait before you know or wrongly choose; red blood will flow. But far from right your choice must be as you approach the trinity."
[78-06] "Aren't you glad I don't speak in rhymes and nonsense?  That would be tiring, wouldn't you say?"
[79-06] "Ah, bonjour. How so very nice to see you again! You have come to pay us what you owe us, no?"
[7A-06] "Oui, oui. He must be here for that very thing. Jean, you are so smart! You are, how they say, the smelliest fish in the drawer!"
[7B-06] "I think you mean the sharpest knife don't you? And since I've never met you, the only thing I owe you is a view of my arse as I leave."
[7C-06] "I think you mean sharpest knife.  And as I've never met you before, it'd be quite impossible for me to owe you anything."
[7D-06] "Wait, wait! Not so fast! Perhaps it is possible we could be mistaken..."
[7E-06] "Perhaps you owe something to someone who owes something to us, no?"
[7F-06] "No, there's no mistake, you two are wasting my time."
[80-06] "I owe a taste of steel to these druids and I'm sure you want none of that."
[81-06] "You have the manners of a peasant! But as I am in such an agreeable mood, I will forgive you your insult and offer instead for you a... how you say, a deal."
[82-06] "Oh, Jean! Jean! Once again you prove we are the cleverest of brothers! Are we not the cleverest of brothers!? Are we not, how you say, sly as boogers?"
[83-06] "Oui! We want to give you a pleasant little tune that will summon the sexiest of beasts to aid in combat. If you would do for us but one small favor, we would give it to you, tout de suit."
[84-06] "Wait, wait!  I am certain that you are certain in your certainty. Therefore, allow me the honor of making amends and proposing to you a... how does one say, a deal."
[85-06] "Oh, Jean! It is just the thing to restore our fallen honor. You are so clever! So wise! So unwashed! Oh, how I wish I was you!"
[86-06] "Oui! We want to give you a pleasant little tune that will summon the sexiest of beasts to aid in combat. If you would do for us but one small favor, we would give it to you, tout de suit."
[87-06] "Do yourself a favor: get your head examined. Tout de suit. I'm outta here."
[88-06] "One small favor. I'll grant you one small favor. Just one.  What is it?"
[89-06] "I knew he would be of no use. But like the hair on my backside, he will return!"
[8A-06] "Tres Magnifique! All you must do for us is to find Donnan who lives very close and collect from him the 50 silver pieces he owes us."
[8B-06] "Oui, oui! Get us the money and we will give you the song!"
[8C-06] "Find Donnan, get the 50 silvers. Done."
[8D-06] "Ah, you see! You have come back."
[8E-06] "Are you ready to do for us that favor?"
[8F-06] "No.  I just popped round to see if you'd give me that tune for free."
[90-06] "All right all right. One favor, just one all right. Now what is it?"
[91-06] "We were not born on the turnip wagon tomorrow, you know!"
[92-06] "He is right! We are smart!  Now go away and do not come back unless you will do us this favor!"
[93-06] "Look here, you malodorous miscreants! Donnan don't owe you a thing!"
[94-06] "Then he is a liar!"
[95-06] "I tell you what. You want the song? We have a silver frog that was taken from us by Caitir and hidden under her bed! Bring that to us and we will give you your song."
[96-06] "Oui, oui! The frog! Get us the frog!"
[97-06] "Get it yourself; I'm not going on another wild goose chase for the two of you."
[98-06] "No tricks now..."
[99-06] "Who said anything about a goose you silly man! We are talking about a frog."
[9A-06] "Quite right! A frog  Small and shiny. And so loveable and cute you know. Oh, Jean! I want it. You promised me you would get it for me and I want it!"
[9B-06] "I won't fall for your tricks again boys."
[9C-06] "No tricks now..."
[9D-06] "Oh, good sir. This is no trick!  I promise it, and of course you know you can trust me!"
[9E-06] "Well?  Are you going to get it or aren't you?"
[9F-06] "No!"
[A0-06] "All right. But this is it. No more funny business."
[A1-06] "Oui! Of course! No more business that is funny. We will await your return!"
[A2-06] "There, there, mon frere. This mean man will not go and get for you your sweet froggie."
[A3-06] "Look here, you bleedin' idiots. Hand over the tune or I'll puree the both of you!"
[A4-06] "Ha! We will be giving you nothing!"
[A5-06] "Oui! Ha! Now go away and stop the wasting of our time!"
[A6-06] "Fine. I'll waste you instead!"
[A7-06] "En garde!"
[A8-06] "En garde!"
[A9-06] "Time to die!"
[AA-06] "Okay, Okay, we surrender already...we can not take this fight any longer..."
[AB-06] "Take it! Take it and go away! Oh, Jean, I think I am going to faint!"
[AC-06] "Frere Jacques, frere Jacques..."
[AD-06] "This is my home! What do you want!?"
[AE-06] "Depends on you. Got any daughters laying about?"
[AF-06] "Nothing at all, my fine fellow. Just passing through."
[B0-06] "I've no daughters nor money for the likes of you."
[B1-06] "Well, then. Good luck to you."
[B2-06] "I told you to go. Don't let the doorknob catch you in the arse on the way out."
[B3-06] "Are you deaf? Go on with you!"
[B4-06] "This is my home! What do you want!?"
[B5-06] "A drink if you've got one. And the 50 silvers you owe the Fox Brothers."
[B6-06] "The Fox Brothers sent me. I think you know why."
[B7-06] "I owe them? Hah! They owe me! And more than fifty. Try five hundred!"
[B8-06] "You've got the five hundred they owe me?"
[B9-06] "Just pay the fifty, old man. I don't know anything about five hundred."
[BA-06] "Five hundred! They said you owed them fifty."
[BB-06] "Then either they're liars or you're an idiot. Which is it?"
[BC-06] "Now wait just a bloody minute here. You don't owe them?"
[BD-06] "They owe you? What kind of nonsense is this?"
[BE-06] "I'm afraid it's true. Wait a moment. They didn't promise you something, did they?  A cut, maybe, or something else worth your while?"
[BF-06] "Look here: if I were you, I'd head back and take it up with them. All right?"
[C0-06] "Off you go, laddie."
[C1-06] "You'd better get going before they try and skip town."
[C2-06] "I'm pleased that we straightened out this mess."
[C3-06] "Hello sir, do you fancy antiques? I've been collecting them for years."
[C4-06] "You're the only thing I fancy."
[C5-06] "No thanks; I'm just browsing."
[C6-06] "Ahh. I know your type. I'm not that kind of woman. Be off wi' ye."
[C7-06] "Well then I'll be seeing you around."
[C8-06] "Persistance will get you nowhere. Leave me be!"
[C9-06] "I hope you are enjoying your visit to Dounby."
[CA-06] "You... back again? I'll call the sheriff if you continue to harass me."
[CB-06] "So you're interested in my antiques are you?"
[CC-06] "Look here, the only thing I want is the silver frog you stole from the Fox brothers. Now hand it over!"
[CD-06] "I'm just here to get back the silver frog."
[CE-06] "Is that what they told you? They tried to buy it from me and I wouldn't part with it.  Now they've sent you here to collect."
[CF-06] "I should've known. They tried to buy it from me and I wouldn't sell it; not for 50 silver pieces not for a thousand!  So now they send you for it."
[D0-06] "Why those bastards! That's twice they've done this to me. I might not have believed you had this not happened before!"
[D1-06] "Bloody hell! That's twice they've fooled me!"
[D2-06] "Give em a swift kick in the gonads for me when you see em."
[D3-06] "From now on you, you best be careful about who you befriend around here."
[D4-06] "Welcome to Dounby. These are dark times, not many visit us these days. Still, we provide healing and blessing for those who care to donate."
[D5-06] "He eluded our traps?"
[D6-06] "He's stronger than anticipated master."
[D7-06] "You men go to the tower. Once he's inside seal the doors, even should he defeat Mannanan that tower will become his tomb."
[D8-06] "Yes my lord."
[D9-06] "Mackay I have a special task for you, this Bard seems more than a match for the men."
[DA-06] "He is indeed master, however if we're given another chance I'm sure..."
[DB-06] "We're running out of chances, you must face him. Intercept him before he reaches the tower... take my pet with you to ensure that he does not survive."
[DC-06] "He doesn't stand a chance."
[15-07] "To spare your life I tell you now a warning you must heed from deep inside you must allow all the courage you shall need for whatever foes lie ahead in wait or what hideous creatures lurk your sword alone will tell your fate for an anti-magic area lies ahead."
[16-07] "Uh...that last part didn't even rhyme. Did it? No. Didn't, did it?"
[17-07] "What do you want?  I'm making this up as I go. You think this is easy? Why don't you try hanging around on a bloody wall for centuries!"
[18-07] "All right, don't go shooting off at the mouth."
[62-07] "Cathbad is faring poorly in his efforts. This... Bard has already evaded one of his traps and has reached the mountain tower alive. Lugh should be able to handle him but take some of the Brothers and ensure he does not leave the tower alive."
[63-07] "Yes my lord."
[64-07] "See that you don't fail. Use any means necessary to stop him. You know what's at stake."
[65-07] "We will do as you command."
[CA-08] "As the Bard drew closer to the Tower in the forest, a scene of great concern to him would play itself out atop another tower, in the city of Dounby, many leagues away..."
[CB-08] "Cathbad, Gather the brothers. Someone is nearing the first tower."
[CC-08] "At once sir."
[CD-08] "Mackay... wake my... pet."
[CE-08] "Yes my lord Fionnaoch."
[F6-08] "You've made a mistake coming here Bard. You have no chance to make it past me, turn around and leave."
[F8-08] "This time I'll take care of you myself Bard."
[FF-08] "My Champion, at last I can look upon your face."
[00-09] "You're even more beautiful in person m'lady. One moment, and I shall free you from your prison."
[01-09] "You are such a fool, Bard."
[02-09] "And may I know the name of the man who thinks me a fool?"
[03-09] "Don't listen to him, he's the one who's been trying to kill you."
[04-09] "Yeah, I've noticed."
[05-09] "My duty is to stop any man who threatens to unleash evil upon the land, and you are that man."
[06-09] "I've been fighting this evil to set the princess free so she can send you and all of your demonic little friends back to hell where you came from."
[07-09] "A place she's very familiar with since that is where she's from. She's the ruler of these fiends you speak of, she is from the very bowels of hell itself!"
[08-09] "I know she's a little bossy, but no reason to get rude."
[09-09] "He lies!  Kill the bastard!"
[0A-09] "You're not helping your case here. Are you insinuating the princess has something to do with everything that's been going wrong in the world?"
[0B-09] "Your betrothed there is the direct cause of it all!"
[0C-09] "Now you've gone too far.  She's not my betrothed!"
[0D-09] "My love, don't you see what he's doing?  This is his last desperate attempt to stop you from setting me free. The minions he's set upon you have failed, so he's resorting to telling you desperate lies. Please don't let him confuse you, he's the one behind all of the evil that assails the land."
[0E-09] "I will fight you if I must, but she is the enemy, not I.  She has been playing you for the fool."
[0F-09] "I'm not stupid. There's no way this woman is the root of all evil.  I mean, look how hot she is, for crying out loud."
[10-09] "You have eyes, yet you do not see. You have ears, yet you do not hear.  You have a brain, but it is located in your..."
[11-09] "Get to the point please."
[12-09] "Caleigh has been held captive here since the last time she attempted to cover the land in darkness, a thousand years ago.  It took the power of four mighty wizards to defeat her and entrap her here, ensuring that her reign of terror was ended. All this time she has been looking for a man, a \"chosen one\" if you will, to set her free so she can rule again. I'm afraid you've been only a pawn in her game... one she will surely dispose of once set free."
[13-09] "This is why I hate dating."
[14-09] "My darling, he speaks half-truths. I was imprisoned here, not by wizards, but by four demonic warlords. You have seen some of them and vanquished them yourself. It was I who defeated their armies although I was weakened in doing so. After the battle they trapped me here while they rebuilt their forces. They will rule this land forever unless you kill him and set me free."
[15-09] "Listen... I think I need to sleep on this."
[16-09] "You must choose now my friend, time is running out."
[17-09] "Look inside your heart love. Set me free."
[18-09] "The time had come. The Bard was forced to choose, and he knew that he had better choose wisely."
[19-09] "If thou were to ask for mine opinion, and thou would be most wise to do so for I am an excellent judge of character. It is plain to me who is the weak and defenseless victim here and who is the blackguard wishing to imprison her. Slay yon vile knave and save thy lovely damsel, I am certain this is the correct course of action."
[1A-09] "Yes, actually, if I look deep into my heart, I can only come to one logical conclusion."
[1B-09] "What is that my love?"
[1C-09] "Never trust a woman."
[1D-09] "What?"
[1E-09] "Wouldn't you know it?  There's always an angle, isn't there?  Give me money... plow the fields... let me out of my magical prison to enslave all of humanity!  And I fell for it... again!"
[1F-09] "Happens to the best of us."
[20-09] "But you and I, we're meant to be..."
[21-09] "Oh give it up! You've been pluckin' my strings from the get go."
[22-09] "And you've been royally plucked."
[23-09] "No more. You know, one minute this beautiful woman appears in a puff of smoke and a flash of light, and the next she turns out to be some sort of evil hellspawn! How do I always miss the subtle signs? Well, let me tell ya, this whole thing, it's over!"
[24-09] "Is there nothing I can say to change your mind?"
[25-09] "There's not even anything you can do to change my mind."
[26-09] "Not even a kiss?"
[27-09] "What?"
[28-09] "You know, a kiss. A simple kiss. It is the only way I can show you how I truly feel."
[29-09] "Oh...well...uhh..."
[2A-09] "Be careful Bard."
[2B-09] "What the hell... I've come all this way.  I mean... a kiss never killed anyone, right?"
[2C-09] "Foolish mortal, you had the chance to rule at my side and live forever... but now you shall die like the dog that you are."
[2D-09] "I tried to warn you."
[2E-09] "Is it me, or is she still hot?"
[2F-09] "Prepare to experience excruciating pain that will last an eternity."
[30-09] "I've already told you... The relationship is off."
[31-09] "I must say that was quite impressive."
[32-09] "You gotta show them who's boss or they'll just walk all over you."
[33-09] "Now that she's gone, things will return to normal. Crops will grow and the dead will remain in their graves. You came very close to destroying life as we know it, but you've redeemed yourself."
[34-09] "Just show me the way out of this damn tower."
[35-09] "Well my friend, we're back in business."
[36-09] "The promise of love and riches, lost. The near destruction of the world as we know it. Death, misery and chaos. Under the weight of such trials most men would emerge changed, some for the better and some for the worse..."
[37-09] "The heart is just a muscle... Nothing more, nothing less."
[38-09] "Perhaps I underestimated you."
[39-09] "Those who are foolish enough to believe the heart is in anyway connected with love, whatever the hell that is, are living in a fantasy world, my friend."
[3A-09] "Then again, I may have been right all along."
[3B-09] "The heart just pumps blood where it needs to go, and that's all that matters to me... if you catch my drift."
[3C-09] "Perhaps I was right all along."
[3D-09] "And after seeing Caleigh and hearing your story..."
[3E-09] "You mean the truth..."
[3F-09] "Well, I must say I am torn. Normally in a situation like this, I'd flip a coin."
[40-09] "I have a coin right here."
[41-09] "But, since she's hot, and you're not... and since she has all the coins I'll ever need... then why waste my time. Sorry my friend, but your story just doesn't wash, she's a thousand years old? Please!"
[42-09] "I knew I could count on you my love."
[43-09] "If that heart of yours pumped some blood to your other head, you'd see what a catastrophic choice you've made."
[44-09] "What, are you blind?  Look at her!"
[45-09] "If you side with Caleigh, this land will be doomed to darkness forever."
[46-09] "I do my best work in the dark."
[47-09] "You really are an idiot. Your foolishness will stop right here... Prepare to die."
[48-09] "Very well. Hold on princess, I'll be back in a minute... maybe two."
[49-09] "Watching you fight... my blood boils for you. You've done it, you've set me free."
[4A-09] "Enough with the words princess."
[4B-09] "Before we embrace, I must take my true form."
[4C-09] "I thought that didn't happen until after ten years of marriage."
[4D-09] "Oh you're going to like this."
[4E-09] "Oh crap! That dead guy was right! You are the Queen of Darkness!"
[4F-09] "Well of course, but does it really matter?"
[50-09] "How does it feel to be at the side of the ruler of the underworld?"
[51-09] "Every woman I was ever involved with ended up being the woman from hell.  Now I have the real thing. Could be fun."
[52-09] "So it was the Bard obtained everything his heart had ever desired... at the expense of the rest of the world of course. Thus concludes the Bard's Tale. Finally the end... I thought I'd never be rid of him... never ask me to read this halfwit's story again."
[53-09] "All right... I've made my choice"
[54-09] "Well it's about bloody time."
[55-09] "Don't get too excited, I didn't choose you."
[56-09] "You choose Caleigh?"
[57-09] "I didn't say that either."
[58-09] "Tell us my champion, whom do you choose?"
[59-09] "A very logical choice... Me."
[5A-09] "You chose you?"
[5B-09] "Exactly."
[5C-09] "What the hell does that mean?  What kind of choice is that?"
[5D-09] "As far as I'm concerned?  An excellent one."
[5E-09] "But what about our future?"
[5F-09] "Well let's look into our crystal ball, shall we?  If I fight either one of you, I could be dead. If I kill one of you, and it's the wrong one, I either end up in hell on earth or in a relationship from hell... literally. So fighting is really a no-win situation."
[60-09] "Even if that fighting can save life as we know it?"
[61-09] "I'll let you two figure that out. In the mean time, these undead aren't a bad lot really."
[62-09] "This is unacceptable you miserable little rat. You will free me, and you will free me now!"
[63-09] "I will rule this land and you will be at my side!"
[64-09] "There's a twist.  I'm intrigued... and oddly aroused... But uh, I'm afraid I still choose to walk away.  Good luck, and oh don't forget to write."
[65-09] "Come back here you disloyal coward and bow before your queen!"
[66-09] "Come back here you weak minded fool and kill your queen!"
[67-09] "You two have serious control issues, you realize that don't you?"
[68-09] "Who says the undead don't know how to party?"
[69-09] "So... Do you die here often?"
[6A-09] "So the Bard decided to take the short and narrow road, otherwise known as the easy way out, to the nearest bar. With the plight of the world obviously far from his mind, which by all accounts, only has room for coin and cleavage, the Bard enjoyed his drinks with his newfound friends, that is until... well that is another story."
[47-0B] "You have received the Knocker"
[5D-0B] "Yes...I think that's good advice, my thanks."
[5E-0B] "They come from that old tower in the middle o' town about a week ago, claimed the place for their Lord Fionnaoch.  You'd do best to steer clear of them if you know what's good for you."
[67-0B] "Donnan"
[68-0B] "Jean"
[69-0B] "Jacques"
[6A-0B] "Sheriff Bryce"
[AE-0B] "Enter the Talent Show"
[AF-0B] "(Low Cheering)"
[B0-0B] "(Moderate Cheering)"
[B1-0B] "(Loud Cheering)"
[B2-0B] "(Low Booing)"
[B3-0B] "(Moderate Booing)"
[B4-0B] "(Loud Booing)"
[BE-0B] "...but the Bard, for the Bard things ended the same way they began."
[BF-0B] "Well my friend, we're back in business."
[C1-0B] "Yes my lord, we have kept the northern passes under watch as you commanded. He will enter the city soon."
[E2-0C] "Dood. That's my name."
[E3-0C] "Nothing goin on here..."
[E4-0C] "Bummer."
[E5-0C] "We've got all sorts of swords, and... Umm stuff."
[E6-0C] "Bows huh?"
[E7-0C] "Armor... It's very... Protected... Protective... Yeah."
[E8-0C] "Special Items... You know my parents keep telling me I'm special."
[F2-0C] "Blessings upon you."
[F3-0C] "You've been good with your donations. I've a gift for you."
[F4-0C] "Welcome back. Care to make a donation?"
[32-0D] "You collect our silvers, and the song is good for you, no?"
[33-0D] "Go find the little frog for my brother Jean, and we will give you your song."
[3B-0D] "Dood"
[3F-0D] "Even now you find ways to reach your servants. This new suitor of yours will fare no better than the others."
[40-0D] "Awaken Herne."
[41-0D] "Fionnaoch. Why do you disturb my vigil?"
[42-0D] "The woman has managed to send messages to her followers again. One of them approaches your tower hoping to free her."
[43-0D] "After all this time still she is strong."
[44-0D] "Deal with this intruder. I'm sending my men to aid you. I needn't remind you of the consequences should you fail."
[45-0D] "I will stop him."
[46-0D] "The brothers are assembling my Lord. We await your instructions."
[47-0D] "Take the men to Herne's tower, I've promised him our aid. Once you've done this, head to the mountains. If all else fails you must stop him there."
[48-0D] "It will be my pleasure master."
[49-0D] "As the Bard strove to complete his quest and rescue the Princess, the enemy grew ever more desperate to put an end to his efforts."
[4A-0D] "Lugh."
[4B-0D] "Herne has fallen."
[4C-0D] "I would disturb your vigil for no other reason."
[4D-0D] "I always thought he was soft. So this man that defeated Herne, he's coming to pay me a visit next?"
[4E-0D] "He's almost there now."
[4F-0D] "It's been a long time since I've had a challenge, this should be amusing."
[50-0D] "Do not underestimate this man Lugh. He is... formidable."
[51-0D] "As formidable as me? I doubt that."
[52-0D] "As unlikely as that possibility may be, I warn you once again to use caution. I'm sending some of my servants to aid you in case..."
[53-0D] "Don't insult me. I'll take care of this problem and I will do it without your aid. I'll speak to you again once he's dead."
[54-0D] "Insufferable man."
[55-0D] "Still, such men have their uses do they not Fionnaoch?"
[56-0D] "I was wondering when you'd regain consciousness. I was rather hoping I'd be spared your company for a while longer."
[57-0D] "You haven't changed much, you never did have anything resembling manners. My champion is going to free me Fionnaoch, I've finally found the right man."
[58-0D] "That remains to be seen."
[59-0D] "If he's too much for your men perhaps you should go see to him personally."
[5A-0D] "Silence."
[5B-0D] "Or can it be that you must maintain proximity to this prison you have me in? That you're using much of your own power to keep me locked away? Do you have enough power left to defeat the Bard when he reaches you? I wonder..."
[5C-0D] "Enough!"
[5D-0D] "I've more than enough power to deal with both of you \"princess\". See that you remember this."
[5E-0D] "What is this Bard of yours trying to accomplish woman? Why is he coming to my city? He can't hope to free you yet, the island tower still stands."
[5F-0D] "I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about \"lord\" Fionnaoch."
[60-0D] "He will fail Caleigh and when he does I will reinforce the strength of your bonds a thousand times over. You will never be free."
[61-0D] "With the Isle Tower close at hand the long journey of the Bard was drawing to a close. Leagues away and unbeknownst to our hero a somewhat familiar scene was being played out."
[62-0D] "At every turn he foils my plans! First Cathbad and then my Pet! What kind of a monster have you enlisted against me Caleigh? Who is this Bard? Where did you find him?"
[63-0D] "He's nobody Fionnaoch. A wanderer, a simple man enlisted in a noble cause, fighting to overthrow a tyrant. It's a familiar story isn't it?"
[64-0D] "Do not mock me. An average man you say? I think not. He leaves a trail of mayhem and destruction in his wake, no ordinary man could have struck down Herne and then Lugh. Still, you give me an interesting notion."
[65-0D] "Which is?"
[66-0D] "You'll find out when he's here. I begin to suspect that he might make it this far."
[67-0D] "Admitting defeat? That's unlike you."
[68-0D] "I admit only the possibility that he may reach this tower alive. Then of course he'll have me to deal with."
[69-0D] "Mannanan."
[6A-0D] "I sense change in the winds Fionnaoch. What is happening?"
[6B-0D] "Herne and Lugh have fallen. Only you and I stand between Caleigh and her freedom."
[6C-0D] "Then we must stand firm."
[6D-0D] "As you say. Mannanan, this man that approaches your tower, he is powerful."
[6E-0D] "A single man has undone both Herne and Lugh?"
[6F-0D] "Indeed he has. Much is riding on your ability to stop him."
[70-0D] "If I should fail, you will avenge me."
[71-0D] "I will."
[72-0D] "Is that an emotion other than anger I hear in your voice Fionnaoch?"
[73-0D] "You'd be surprised what the years can do to a man."
[80-0E] "So what'll it be?"
[81-0E] "What'll you be havin' today?"
[82-0E] "Ah this is one helluva stout. A strong rich malty flavor with a hint of hops. Goes down nice and creamy and leaves ya a bit o' foam in the mug to remember it by."
[83-0E] "Is it a beer? A whiskey? A wine? To tell you the truth I'm not sure. But I can tell you that if your feeling a bit o' luck you can't go wrong with this one."
[84-0E] "This stuff gives swill a bad name. Trust me ye'd be best to steer clear of it unless you fancy feeling like you got hit over the head with a caber."
[85-0E] "Bugbear's light? All the taste of a normal brew but with only half the calories. Watching your weight are you?"
[86-0E] "A wonderful vintage with a fine bouquet... ach who am I kidding. I'm only selling this stuff because the woman what brews it is errr... quite charming."
[87-0E] "Come again."
[88-0E] "We'll see you next time."
[AD-0E] "The Bard needed to take MacRath to Dounby where Dugan could hopefully unravel the mystery of his strange speech."
[B8-0E] "I could use a bit of silver. I'll enter your show."
[B9-0E] "I'm a professional, I've got no time for your little show."
[BA-0E] "Sorry, but we've a limit on the number of times you can win, try again next year."
[BB-0E] "Would you like to enter again? I'm sure you can do better this time."
[00-0F] "You collect our silvers, and the song is good for you, oui?"
[01-0F] "Go find the frog for my brother Jacques and we will give you your song."
[24-13] "Nuckelavee Song"
[2C-13] "The Bard knew that he had better keep his new companion alive, at least long enough to figure out what he was saying."
[2D-13] "Having failed to protect the incoherent man from his enemies, the Bard headed back to Dounby to see if Dugan could make sense of the current situation."
[2E-13] "Perhaps Dugan could unravel the mystery of the deceased gentleman who nobody could understand."
[47-13] "What are ya doing here Lad? Word around town is that you got out with yer skin intact. I was just about to sneak out myself, it's getting unpleasant round here."
[48-13] "This MacRath fellow that I was supposed to meet. What does he look like?"
[49-13] "Well, he's a large fellow, not a lot of hair on his head, fancies himself a bit of a snappy dresser."
[4A-13] "You forgot the part where nobody can understand what the bloody hell he's saying."
[4B-13] "Oh you've met him then. Sorry that part slipped my mind. Did you get the Axe?"
[4C-13] "No. There was a slight communication problem. And seeing as how he's dead I doubt that its going to get any better although you never can tell these days."
[4D-13] "Sad to hear it, he was an old friend. Still he was supposed to be keeping that axe for you safe in his dungeon. It'd be hard to get in through the front but there's a back entrance through the graveyard and I just so happen to have the key. Here you go."
[4E-13] "And you didn't give this to me in the first place because..."
[4F-13] "You shouldn't have needed it, how was I supposed to know you were going to go and get him killed, that wasn't part of the plan!"
[50-13] "Of course not. It never is. But once, just once it'd be nice if you people thought of these things ahead of time!"
[51-13] "Just you get the Axe and then head to the third Tower. Its on a small island just off the coast, you should be able to secure passage there quite easily."
[52-13] "Secure passage easily? Haven't we learned our bloody lesson! And how many undead hordes do you think I'll have to fight my way through to secure this easy passage?"
[53-13] "Why what have you heard? Nevermind, if you'll excuse me, I'm getting out of here before those Druids learn you've come back to town. I suggest you follow my lead."
[C0-13] "I'll tattle a tale that is terribly true,  started out as a rumor but suddenly grew.  And it deals with a man and a horse and a ring.  So settle on in and our song we shall sing.  It happened one day in a ring by a farm, something that tragically brought us much harm.  How could a place abundant with charm create such a beast with a spear for an arm?  On death and destruction is what you will get when he's coming for you in your kilt you will wet,  and he's big and he's strong and its quite plain to see that this is the tale of the Nuckelavee. Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee your big and evil and heinous.  Who could it be who set you free?  He really must be an anus. Oh Nuckelavee its easy to see the terror you leave is raining on me.  The village is burned and the taverns are missed and the beer is all gone and the elders are pissed.  And if they ever should find the fool we'll hang him upside down by his tool,  and spin him around until he gets sick, Ooh!  Aah!  Oh that should do the trick, HEY! Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee the terror you offer is high class. Who could he be who set you free? He really must be a dumb ass.  Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee the horror you furnish is widespread. Who could it be who set you free? He really must be an ox head. Now everyone knows no blood should spill in the sacred ring by the farm on the hill and if this ever happens then death you should fear. He'll kick in your nuts and he'll serve them with beer. So one final thought before I depart and this my friend comes straight from the heart.  We'd all be fine if not for that bell and that horse killing wanker who opened up hell.  Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee we cannot win we must admit. Who could it be who set you free?  He really must be a dim-wit.  Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee are big and evil and heinous.  Who could it be who set you free?  He really must be an anus."
[76-14] "This portly fellow was difficult for anyone let alone the Bard to understand. The only course of action that our Hero could think of was to take him back to Dounby to see Dugan."

One would think that fame and glory could be bought.  When it comes to Chosen Ones there are a lot.  There seems to be too many.  I don't really think there's any.
