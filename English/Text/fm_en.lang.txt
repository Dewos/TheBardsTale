[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[C1-02] "No! Damn... I mean... go away!"
[C2-02] "I don't know, you don't sound very nice."
[C3-02] "Tell you what, you go save the world, I'll stay right here where it's safe."
[C4-02] "No."
[C5-02] "Ahhhhhhh!"
[C6-02] "Thank you for saving my life... I guess you might be a decent fellow after all."
[C7-02] "Alright. Just don't hurt me, you said you meant no harm."
[C8-02] "I'm very sorry I didn't come outta hiding sooner but you see I've been down here a while, always running from the finfolk not to mention that crazy Viking. He thinks I'm in league with the finfolk, if you can imagine that."
[C9-02] "He's just an insane old man who runs off at the mouth. I lead him and his brother down here, helped them navigate the tunnels. I turn around for one moment and the two of them have gone off somewhere. Not that I was sad to see them go, if you think he talks too much you should have heard his brother. So I go looking for them and when the finfolk jump me I give out a yell for help and go hide myself. The next thing I know he's calling me a traitor and trying to kill me! I just want to get out of here with my skin intact."
[CA-02] "He's just an insane old man who runs off at the mouth, whatever you do don't let him launch into one of his stories... I'd rather be run through by a finfolk. I've been trapped down here for so long... always fearing for my life... I'm at my wits end. Now you must have gotten down here somehow... can you show me a way out?"
[CB-02] "Ok I get it... well the only thing I have of any value are the armbands my father left me... I... well, ok I'll let you have it if you show me a way out of here, it's all I have."
[CC-02] "Thanks!  Let's go."
[CD-02] "A deal's a deal, so I'll give you my armbands, even though you've done little to deserve them.  Well... good luck and good riddance."
[CE-02] "Here take this, its my most precious possession in the world. My father gave it to me when I was younger, but I want to thank you for what you've done for me."
[CF-02] "I'm not going that way, the Viking is over there and he'd like nothing better than to skewer me. You can go, but I'll wait here, thank you."
[D0-02] "Ready to go? I certainly am."
[D1-02] "You seem to be in quite a hurry my friend, why all the hacking? Is the ore going somewhere?"
[D2-02] "Well, you know what they say, survival of the fittest... Circle of life, and all that rubbish.  And I might add..."
[D3-02] "Don't let me interrupt your digging.  Ahh reminds me, when I was a kid my dog once buried my sister and I..."
[D4-02] "Sorry not the digging type. I might help in some other way if there were something in it for me."
[D5-02] "Yeah, yeah, digging isn't exactly my forte... is there any other way I could help?"
[D6-02] "There's Trouble. Come with me!"
[D7-02] "I see my work is done here.  Now I believe there was mention of some extra silver for my hard labor."
[D8-02] "I doubt that very much, only one thing interests me more than silver, and I don't find Firbolgs attractive in the least.  Nothing personal."
[D9-02] "Not many things interest me more than silver, but I'm listening."
[DA-02] "Magical sword that sings? Right. Most likely a scam of some sort, and even if it was true, a sword that sings isn't exactly that appealing to me, I don't need the competition.  I'll take the silver if you please."
[DB-02] "Let's not be hasty, a magical sword sounds like just the sort of thing I could make use of."
[DC-02] "Oh, was quite rewarding, glad I could help. Now speaking of rewards..."
[DD-02] "You look pretty familiar... oh gods did you get yourself trapped in another cave-in?"
[DE-02] "I'd say you owe me a little more than that."
[DF-02] "You're entirely mistaken about that let me assure you."
[E0-02] "Fork it over already!"
[E1-02] "Leave it to you to put a negative twist on the whole thing."
[E2-02] "Well as I live and breath, it is true... you speak.  I can only pray that your edge is as sharp as your tongue.   And you have things turned around I think... I hope you serve me better than you did your former wielder."
[E3-02] "You'd be surprised as to what I'd believe.  Now keep quiet we have finfolk to skewer."
[E4-02] "I have a better question.  Why are Vikings all so damn ugly?  I mean it's obviously hereditary, but is it me or is it getting worse with time?  Ah dear... as for your second question, I'll hear your name before I give you mine"
[E5-02] "Well I am a simple traveler really, a singer of songs and teller of tales, now who may I ask are you?"
[E6-02] "I hate to interrupt but..."
[E7-02] "Could you be quiet?"
[E8-02] "Please shut your gob."
[E9-02] "Shut the Bloody hell up and get to the point!"
[EA-02] "Interesting."
[EB-02] "I see."
[EC-02] "By all means continue."
[ED-02] "Fascinating."
[EE-02] "You use your words efficiently... far less content, but surprisingly just as annoying."
[EF-02] "You really know how to inspire confidence don't you."
[F0-02] "Is anyone there?"
[F1-02] "Whoever you are you best come out from behind there.  When I have to look for people I tend to get very cranky... and then people end up dying."
[F2-02] "I'm losing my patience here, I've got a princess to save and I'll feed you to the finfolk if you waste any more of my time."
[F3-02] "Come out by the time I count to 3."
[F4-02] "1...2..."
[F5-02] "I never meant you any harm, I'm just not big on people who lurk."
[F6-02] "Come out friend, I mean you no harm."
[F7-02] "I haven't seen any Vikings down here, but I've certainly seen plenty of finfolk  about."
[F8-02] "Ah yeah, the Viking, yes I've had the pleasure of meeting him. He wants you dead for some reason you know."
[F9-02] "I'd uhh, be happy to guide you out of this place, but uhh well, I'm sure you know, a good guide doesn't come cheap."
[FA-02] "I can lead you to the boat that brought me here, follow me."
[FB-02] "Here you go. The bloody deed is done."
[FC-02] "Thanks, now I believe you have some payment for me?"
[FD-02] "Enough with the tales, teach me what you know."
[FE-02] "A group of us were working here, putting up support beams when we were attacked by a pack of Finfolk. During the fight this tunnel collapsed and several of the other miners were trapped."
[FF-02] "I don't have time to talk right now! They're running out of air, help me dig them out!"
[00-03] "There are more miners down here but they scattered during the attack. If you can gather them and bring them back here, they could help me dig. I'll make this worth your while if you help."
[01-03] "Bah! You greedy... argh... I have no choice. There were other miners down here but they were scattered during the attack. Bring them back here to help me dig. Take this for starters and there'll be more where that came from if we can rescue them."
[02-03] "Actually, I've got something that may interest you more than silver."
[03-03] "Have it your way, I'm sure a magical sword is of no use to you."
[04-03] "We found this strange sword down here while we were excavating, it seems to... well it sings."
[05-03] "Ok men back to work time to clear out those tunnels to the east."
[06-03] "Damn us all... we weren't fast enough."
[07-03] "Clear out the eastern tunnels... we need room to bury them."
[08-03] "Hehe yeah I did and you got me out again. I owe you my thanks."
[09-03] "Always joking, I see right through you. You talk tough but inside you're all heart."
[0A-03] "You can't fool me! And even though I know you'll try to refuse any reward I'm afraid I must insist."
[0B-03] "Ok here it is, good luck my friend!"
[0C-03] "Oh for heaven's sake you don't look very formidable. As a matter of fact, you don't look like much of anything.  I hope you do better then my previous wielder."
[0D-03] "He was gone in the head, my former master. Kept insisting he was the chosen one if you can believe that rubbish. You don't seem much better."
[0E-03] "Can't talk now. Busy digging."
[0F-03] "Careful down here there are fin folk about."
[10-03] "Go away I'm busy."
[11-03] "Whew, I could use a break."
[12-03] "I'll follow you!"
[13-03] "Good to see a friendly face. Lead the way."
[14-03] "Let's go."
[15-03] "Lead the way."
[16-03] "The Bard found himself in a place where there was no night or day, no warmth of the sun, and air so foul every breath was an effort. Into these tunnels more suited to Firbolgs and Finfolk the Bard bravely strode, determined to complete his noble quest... certain death lurked around every corner... a violent messy death at the hands of some foul subterranean denizen."
[17-03] "And so, having failed to rescue the trapped Miners, The Bard continued his journey... while the Firbolgs buried their dead."
[18-03] "A wise man once said, He who fights and runs away, won't find his guts splattered all over the ground.  Best find safe haven my friend."
[19-03] "And you thought I was long winded."
[1A-03] "As the Bard ventured further into the caves, the sight of the scorched ground concerned him.  Wait... it did concern him didn't it?  Because it really should have."
[1B-03] "So once again, having left a wake of death and destruction behind him, the Bard continued onward towards the Island tower in search of the fair maiden Caleigh. You may ask yourself, was his mind weighed down with the burden of saving the world? The lives he had taken? Friends he had lost? Or was he just wondering what the princess looks like naked? I'm sure that answer is painfully obvious."
[1C-03] "Just a moment stranger, for I can see you are neither finfolk nor Firbolg.  Now who are you, and more importantly, what are you doing here?"
[1D-03] "I am called Olav. I am a Viking from Stromness, as to why I am lost here, that's easy enough."
[1E-03] "After the firbolgs first dug their way down here and found these waterfilled tunnels, me and my brother Erik came down with a firbolg guide now what was his name... lets see.. it was baleock or something, but that's not important right now more on that treacherous dog later."
[1F-03] "Anyways we came down here to explore, y'know see if there was any treasure to be had maybe a nice vein of ore. So we brought a small boat with us, I'm a pretty decent shipwright myself did I mention that?"
[20-03] "Now when we were younger my brother was always the one who was better at building things, me I've always been good at knocking em down if you know what I mean, of course what use is a Viking that can't take care of his ship?"
[21-03] "So I spent several years in Jordland studying under old Skeggi the master shipwright, surely you've heard of him? Of course you have everyone has... it was his boat Draugrimmer that lead the fleet of Kolskegg the bloody in his famous raids off the black coast."
[22-03] "So I was saying we have our ship down here and we're navigating these tunnels when we come upon a bit of dry land, anyways Erik and I are hauling the boat out of the water we port it over to the other side and manage to get it back into the water when we notice the firbolg is missing."
[23-03] "So we go off to look for him, we hear him calling out to us down one of those side passages to the east and we get jumped by a whole horde of finfolk."
[24-03] "Now finfolk as you know are notorious for using magic and it just so happened that in my younger days I picked up a little trick to deal with such things, you see it all started when old Thorvald the weaponsmith he tells me about this island that he saw when he was but a lad and he says to me Olav he says you're the best sailor I ever laid eyes on and if anyone can get out and find that island it's you."
[25-03] "Now of course at this point I'm swelling with pride because Thorvald he's served with some fine old sailors as I'm sure I don't have to tell you, there's old Bjornulf red beard, Arnor Ketilson, Ketil Arnorson, and Ranulf Ildharson to name but a few."
[26-03] "So at any rate I sail out to this island with my brother Erik you remember me talking about him right? Poor lad never had a chance against those finfolk, I tried to save him but I was too late... that treacherous firbolg lead us into a trap he did, killed my brother and left me stranded down here."
[27-03] "My apologies, sometimes I forget myself and run off at the mouth, the short of it is I'd like you to kill this firbolg for me, he's in the caverns to the east. In exchange, I will share with you the secret of dispelling magic. Just bring me proof that he's dead."
[28-03] "And that is my sad sad tale, brings a tear to your eyes does it not? Aye I can see you are all choked up by it. Yer a good lad to let an old man run off at the mouth like that. Here take this stone, I found it down here, and I have no use for it. And tell you what, if you do in the firbolg, I'll teach you how to dispel magic, might help you get past those finfolk. He hides himself in the caverns east of here, just bring me back proof that he's dead."
[29-03] "I'd love to share my secrets with you but you've gotta bring me proof that you've done in that firbolg."
[2A-03] "Well are ye done with yer little mission?"
[2B-03] "His armband eh? Yes, yes this is good proof. He was always boasting about how great his father was and how it'd been his most precious possession, he'd never have given it up. I have no use for the damn thing, so you keep it."
[2C-03] "Payment? Oh yes, yes. I learnt this secret when I was younger... it was on the Isle of the winged...."
[2D-03] "Of course, no need to get violent..."
[1A-07] "AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
[C5-09] "We haven't heard from the villagers of Stromness in a while, I wonder if something happened to them?"
[C6-09] "We sent a messenger to ask the vikings for help with the Finfolk, but he hasn't returned."
[C7-09] "I never really wanted to be a miner, I hear lumberjacking is a lot more fun."
[C8-09] "Let's go!"
[C9-09] "We have to hurry!"
[CA-09] "I'll be right behind you."
[31-0B] "Grouse"
[32-0B] "Please...I beg you..."
[33-0B] "It seemed that this defenseless firbolg was in need of a courageous hero, the sort of man willing to brave untold danger to rescue the innocent."
[34-0B] "Oh, this should be good.  Where are you going to get some idiot to do that?"
[35-0B] "I was referring to you."
[36-0B] "I find I'm more productive when I focus on one quest at a time.  Besides, this firbolg isn't really my type."
[37-0B] "Have you ever thought of seeking therapy?"
[38-0B] "Why? It's not like I listen to the condescending voice in my head."
[39-0B] "Fine, fine, I'll save him, I'll save him, but get this, this is the last time I save an ugly person."
[3B-0B] "You have received the Falstone Token."
[3C-0B] "You have received the Firbolg Armbands."
[3D-0B] "Bodyguard has been upgraded."
[3E-0B] "You have received the Ego Sword."
[A3-0B] "More wishful thinking than anything else."
[A4-0B] "I certainly hope that you're exaggerating."
[A5-0B] "Nice."
[A6-0B] "Remember the pointy end goes into the enemy you simpleton."
[A7-0B] "This is going to be just wonderful. Now shut your... whatever it is"
[A8-0B] "So it came to be that the Bard found the perfect match for his own charming personality."
[A9-0B] "Well I am a bastard sword you know."
[41-0E] "Hello there. I'm not interrupting anything am I?"
[8C-0E] "I can make it. I'm the chosen one... I can make it... I'm the chosen one."
[8D-0E] "Hello there. I'm not interrupting anything am I?"
[8E-0E] "Who are you? You don't seem like one of those Druids... did Dugan send you to help me?"
[8F-0E] "Did Dugan send me? Yeah you could say that... so you're the Chosen One are you?"
[90-0E] "Oh you heard that... yes I am the Chosen One."
[91-0E] "Well you may be A chosen one but you're not THE chosen one."
[92-0E] "The Chosen One eh? How did you go about getting stuck with that?"
[93-0E] "What do mean by that? They've all told me I'm the one!"
[94-0E] "Well... It all started at home, my Father had gone over to the neighbors for..."
[95-0E] "Your father? You mean you're not an orphan?"
[96-0E] "Well... actually I am an orphan. I call the man who raised me Father... how did you know?"
[97-0E] "Just a lucky guess, keep going with your story."
[98-0E] "So he went away to the neighbors and I went to look for him. Well I got lost along the way and met this mysterious man out in the woods... he's the one who first told me about the princess and that I was the Chosen one."
[99-0E] "So someone tells you you're the chosen one and you just believe them? You haven't noticed all the other chosen ones running about by any chance? The dead ones?"
[9A-0E] "Look lad I don't know how you've made it this far but I've run into a lot of chosen ones so far and you're the first one who was in any condition to speak to, if you catch my drift."
[9B-0E] "Yeah that means that THEY weren't the Chosen One. I am the chosen one and I'll prove it right now."
[9C-0E] "It's been difficult but if I just believe in myself then I can do anything. If I believe I am the Chosen One then I can make it over to that chest and back to safety."
[9D-0E] "I'd really like to see that."
[9E-0E] "Bad choice chosen one... for you at least."
[9F-0E] "You can do what you want of course but I wouldn't set foot in that room if I were you."
[A0-0E] "What? But why not?"
[A1-0E] "Why not? Because it's a bloody room full of bleeding lava you halfwit! You wouldn't get two steps into that room before you burst into flame and die a horrible pointless and very very painful death."
[A2-0E] "I...I suppose you're right but what am I going to do? I can't make it past those finfolk, I'm stuck."
[A3-0E] "Well you could wait here where its safe, I'll think of some way to get past the finfolk. Say you wouldn't have anything on you that could help me out would you?"
[A4-0E] "I don't know... what sort of thing do you mean."
[A5-0E] "Oh anything really... the odd trow charm, ancient scrolls, magical swords that sort of thing... since you won't be needing them any longer."
[A6-0E] "Sure... I have some stuff like that. Here you go... I'll ummm just wait here I suppose..."
[A7-0E] "So if I'm not THE chosen one then who is? Is it you?"
[A8-0E] "There is no chosen one lad, I've seen enough of the world to know that there's no grand plan for anything."
[A9-0E] "But then who is going to rescue the princess and save the world?"
[AA-0E] "I'll see to the princess and the world... well the world can pretty much look after itself."
[AB-0E] "I'm so confused...I've got a lot to think about."
[6C-13] "Press [7D-00] to launch raft."
[84-14] "A magical barrier barred our Heroes way. If only he had a way to neutralize magic."
[85-14] "With his Bodyguard able to absorb magic, the Bard should have been able to bypass the Finfolk's barrier quite easily."
