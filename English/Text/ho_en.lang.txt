[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[03-00] "I don't need your 'help' little man"
[AF-00] "Get your own brew!"
[B0-00] "What are you, the town drunk?  Buy your own!"
[B1-00] "Very simple. (Glowering at patron) Touch my brew again, and die!"
[B2-00] "You were warned my friend."
[B3-00] "It had come to this, at last.  One man on his own.  A poet and a rogue, with no friends to speak of, no one to mourn his passing should it come to that.  Even those beside him are no more boon companions than bondservants, summoned by sorcery and song, as cold and indifferent to him as the light of a wandering star."
[B4-00] "But to know where he is, and what may yet come to pass, we need to know who he is and where he is from..."
[B5-00] "And to know that, we've got to begin elsewhere..."
[B6-00] "And not that long ago. A simple man he was, neither laird nor lackey but a free man, with a quick wit and a sharp tongue, an eye for the lasses and a talent for keeping one step ahead of the law, come to Houton to play his tunes and make his way, as he has been doing all his life."
[B7-00] "He found himself standing outside the The Drunken Rat, a public house owned by the Widow Mary MacRary. The Bard readied his instrument and prepared to ply his trade."
[B8-00] "All hail the Bard, Rat-Killer and Rodent-Bane, who has bravely made the cellars once again safe for Buxom Bar Maids and Wanton Widows!"
[B9-00] "Or has he...?"
[BA-00] "The Bard finding himself wreathed in flame dashed up the stairs towards the safety of the tavern!"
[BB-00] "Run for it lad and live to fight another day!"
[BC-00] "All hail the Bard, Rat-Killer and Rodent-Bane, who has bravely made the cellars..."
[BD-00] "So The Bard headed up to his room to avail himself of the pleasures that the Inn had to offer."
[BE-00] "Having spent a lonely night in a somewhat uncomfortable and shabby bed the Bard awoke the next morning in a foul humor."
[BF-00] "Soon the Bard had begun to realize that he had been tricked into wasting his time."
[C0-00] "Of course, it was painfully obvious to the rest of us from the beginning."
[C1-00] "Thank goodness the heroic Bard was present to STOP that horrible Bugbear from looting the tomb of all its' precious treasures."
[C2-00] "Ahh!  A rat!  A rat!"
[C3-00] "You drunken louts! Get off your backsides and kill it!"
[C4-00] "Ah, what a strapping man you are, to be savin' me from that wee beastie."
[C5-00] "No, but aren't you the sweet one for asking.  Say, I've an idea.  If you'd be willing to do a little job for me, I'd give you a good meal..."
[C6-00] "...and a warm place to lay your head for the night..."
[C7-00] "Then it's a deal!  For it's a wee rat problem I've got in my cellars, and if you could do away with 'im, I'd be ever so thankful."
[C8-00] "You'll need a bigger sword than what you've got.  In case you run into trouble."
[C9-00] "Well, for someone who says he's not afraid of rats, you are sure procrastinating.  If you are afraid you can tell me... I won't have any interest in speaking with you any further... but you can tell me."
[CA-00] "Nicely done...or is that 'well-done'?"
[CB-00] "Now have another go at him with this!"
[CC-00] "You aren't still mad at me, are you?  If you get down there and kill that bad, horrible, awful monster we can kiss and make up..."
[CD-00] "Ooh. You're little friend's givin' me quite a charge. Bring him round again some time, won't you?"
[CE-00] "Run away again, did you?  Go back to where you came from and leave the fightin' to those who've got the guts for it."
[CF-00] "No need.  The stench you bring with you will be proof enough."
[D0-00] "Well, maybe there's more to you than meets the eye...?"
[D1-00] "You mean it's dead!?  Oh, thank you.  I can't tell you how grateful I am."
[D2-00] "Right away, I enjoy a man with a quick tongue. I'll see you get the finest room in the Inn, it's the one right next to mine."
[D3-00] "Why don't you wait while I fix you some leftovers... oh and your room in the back is almost ready."
[D4-00] "That was quite a night, I'm afraid you almost made me late opening the bar this morning. Oh, that strange friend of yours is waiting for you outside, I had to chase him away, he was unnerving some of my regulars. See you later love."
[D5-00] "You should go speak with that strange friend of yours he was starting to scare away my regular customers, I had to chase him out."
[D6-00] "Good day. What'll you have?"
[D7-00] "Oh, welcome back love, look that was nice and all but you aren't gonna start hanging about all day are you?"
[D8-00] "Hello there, no more rat problems in here so not much work for the likes of you."
[D9-00] "Good day."
[DA-00] "Well, hello again. Have you seen all the undead outside? You'd think I'd be scared, but my customers have been worthless zombies for years, so I'm used to it."
[DB-00] "I've seen yer trick before Bard, I won't be fallin' for it a second time."
[DC-00] "I'll save you, fair damsel!"
[DD-00] "I happened to be wandering by when I heard your cries over the rumbling of my empty belly. You aren't hurt, are you?"
[DE-00] "I'd be only too happy to handle anything you'd like to heave my way..."
[DF-00] "Rats you say? In the cellar... how clich√© of you love, but I'll forgive you this once."
[E0-00] "Oh, my sword is quite big enough to handle any \"troubles\" you might have."
[E1-00] "Let's call that my tip"
[E2-00] "Quest Complete!"
[E3-00] "You better hope I've cooled off when I return or you're next!"
[E4-00] "It had better be more than a kiss to make up for that."
[E5-00] "Who the hell are you? How did you get down here?"
[E6-00] "Go on. Clear off out of it! I've no use for you."
[E7-00] "Great, so now the rat gets dinner and a show?  If it's so bloody powerful, use it yourself and save me the trouble."
[E8-00] "Done. Show me what you've got."
[E9-00] "Bloody hell!"
[EA-00] "How 'bout you tell the story and leave the sarcastic patronizing to me, okay!"
[EB-00] "Oh no.  The rat is the gutless one, for I spilt his about your cellar. I'd be only to happy to haul him up here for you to see....in fact, it might actually improve the ambiance of this place."
[EC-00] "I've plenty of guts, Milady, which is why you needn't trouble yourself about that rat any longer."
[ED-00] "Save it for the half-wits; what you can do for me is best done in silence. You knew what was down there, you and all the rest of your tartan-clad trash. So how about less chatter and more chow. And be quick about it."
[EE-00] "T'was the least I could do for a damsel in distress.  Now...how about that meal?"
[EF-00] "Look here laddie, don't be concerning yerself with such things right now. I'm here to help ye with yer rat problem. Any brute can swing a sword; if ye really want to slay that hairy beastie, try playing this tune on that lute of yours."
[F0-00] "I'm not offerin' to go with ye, laddie.  I'm offerin' ye a bit o' song an' magic that'll bring ye back in one piece."
[F1-00] "Would that I could. But I'm not a man o' action like yerself. So do yerself a favor an' take a little charity when it's offered my boy."
[F2-00] "hah hahah ahaha hahaha"
[F3-00] "hah hahah ahaha hahaha"
[F4-00] "Hey I understand your hesitation stranger... there isn't enough ale in this town to get me to go down there.  Then again, I'm a cowering sort."
[F5-00] "Not well done.  More like medium rare."
[F6-00] "Don't feel too bad, laddie; I've a bigger rat back home.  Hell, I'm married to it."
[F7-00] "Hey!  Can't you read!  No pets allowed."
[F8-00] "Very impressive young man.  I wish I had the guts to stand up to the wife the way you stood up to that rat... but of course she's a lot more vicious."
[F9-00] "I'm sure you've seen all the hideous things going on out there.  Most likely the end is near, but fortunately I finally have a good excuse not to go home to the wife."
[FA-00] "What are you, a man or a mouse?  Get down there and Mary may have a go with you.  You wouldn't want to be the only man in town she hasn't had a go with, would you?"
[FB-00] "What's that son?  I can't hear you!  Rat got your tongue?"
[FC-00] "Take him outside!  One little spark and you'll blow this pub to the moon!"
[FD-00] "Yeah, yeah, yeah... so you killed a rat... what do you want, a medal?"
[FE-00] "You should just stay in here and get drunk with us my friend.  The whole town is going to hell in a basket, so what the hell are we gonna need a liver for?"
[FF-00] "That Rat is not going to kill itself!  Get down there and earn a meal for once!"
[00-01] "Hey not so close fellow, your still smoking and this drink is flamable!"
[01-01] "Shocking, shocking. Absolutely shocking!"
[02-01] "You killed it? You killed it? The Fire Breathing Rat in the Cellar was the best practical Joke we had!  Now what are we supposed to do to entertain ourselves?"
[03-01] "Well the best part about the dead rising is that now our Giant Rat is ready and waiting for the next stranger to wander into town."
[04-01] "Dummy string."
[05-01] "What'd I tell ye, lad?  Ye hooked him and cooked him!"
[06-01] "Ye're welcome, boyo. And should ye be looking for another one like it, find the Trow in the Fairyhaunt woods. But keep yer wits about ye; they're devilish clever, the Trow, with magic by the pound and not a single scrap o' honesty."
[07-01] "Come now boyo, what's a little danger when compared to power? Didn't that little trick I showed ya help ye get in good with the widow Macrary? If it's yer skin that ye're worried about I've a wee trinket here that'll keep ye safe from harm."
[08-01] "Come now boyo, what's a little danger when compared to power. If ye'd had a bit more power maybe the widow Macrary would've taken more of a liking to ya? If it's yer skin you're worried about I've a wee trinket here that'll keep ye safe from harm."
[09-01] "Thanks to that song you gave me."
[0A-01] "Do I look like the village idiot to you?  I've had more than my fill of barbarian hordes, evil wizards, cities locked in eternal winter and any other type of adventure you'd care to throw my way. There's too much danger and not enough profit to go around."
[0B-01] "Hmm, sounds a little dangerous to me, I don't care much for Trow. I think I'll pass."
[0C-01] "She's very beautiful, but I've found that mysterious strangers offering gifts usually lead to trouble, you wouldn't want anything from me would you? Have any ulterior motives by any chance?"
[0D-01] "You've obviously heard of me so you know I'm not a man to be trifled with. I've come to learn a bit of magic and I won't take no for an answer."
[0E-01] "You must be Bannafeet. I've been sent here about a tune you might be willing to part with."
[0F-01] "You must be joking."
[10-01] "You people try my patience, ok I'll do it."
[11-01] "Well I might be persuaded."
[12-01] "Ok, I'll do it, but you had better keep your end of the bargain"
[13-01] "All right, let's hear this favor then"
[14-01] "Done. Just have that song for me when I get back. I'm no man's errand boy."
[15-01] "Well now, who've we here, eh?  You must be the fellah who's been chasin' all over, puttin' the touch on the locals with that shockin' beast of yours."
[16-01] "Oh, don't hurt me, friend, don't hurt me and I'll tell you where to find a song worth knowin'."
[17-01] "Go back into the center of town and head to the town well. Climb down to the bottom of it and there you will find exactly what you deserve."
[18-01] "Tis no joke my friend, what yer lookin' for is at the bottom of that well."
[19-01] "Well, I've half a mind to gut you like a fish, but you're likeable enough I suppose.  If you weren't, I'd send you down to the well and be done with you.  But... It just so happens I do know a bit of magic, and I'd be willing to teach it to you, if you were to do something for me in return."
[1A-01] "There's a man in the forest jail by the name of Ketill Swart.  Spring him free for me and you'll get your song. You don't have to worry about any guards at the Jail, they've been chased off by the Kunal Trow. I can't help you with the patrols, but you can get through the door with only a password.  Just tell the Trow guarding the door \"fiddlesnarf\" and he'll let you in with no questions asked. When Ketil is free, come back here and I'll teach you some magic. Fair enough?"
[1B-01] "Now it just so happens that I do know a wee song, and if you'd do me a little favor, I might be willing to part with it"
[1C-01] "I've a friend in the forest jail by the name of Ketill Swart.  Spring him free for me and you'll get your song. You don't have to worry about any guards at the Jail, they've  been chased off by the Kunal Trow.  I can't help you with their patrols, but you can get through the door with only a password.  You'll need to say \"fiddlesnarf\" to the Kunal Trow guarding the door to be let in."
[1D-01] "So, just get him out, and then come back here and I'll teach you some magic. Fair enough?"
[1E-01] "Well, look who it is!  Find anything interesting in the well?"
[1F-01] "Maybe now you'll have a wee bit more respect for your betters, eh?"
[20-01] "Look here, calm down. I was just having a wee bit of fun at your expense no need to get murderous about it."
[21-01] "You call yourself a dog!?  I've seen rats bigger than you!  Go away!"
[22-01] "Well now, you're a spry little thing. I could do with a friend. Care to throw in with me?"
[23-01] "How 'bout some cheese to go with that whine!?  I've had enough overgrown rats!  Now clear off out of here, you runt!"
[24-01] "I'm sorry, boy, but I have seen a rat bigger than you. He was twice my size, and almost cooked me for lunch. I'll tell you what: you come with me and we'll look out for one another. Whattya say?"
[25-01] "You'll find nothing in here sir. And you best be off or I'll call the Sheriff on ya."
[26-01] "AAAAAHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!"
[27-01] "What d'ye want?  If you're a thief, you'll get nothin' from me; for I've only these old bones and a heavy heart."
[28-01] "I know how you might come by some money, you impudent rascal!  For it's a cruel Bugbear that's been keepin' the farmers from observin' their rituals in the Houton Cairn.  Without 'em, the crops won't grow and the wee'uns go hungry."
[29-01] "Of course you are, young sir.  And I happen to know how you might find some. For it's a cruel Bugbear that's been keepin' the farmers from observin' their rituals. And us farmers have to perform our rituals at the Houton Cairn, without 'em, the crops won't grow and the wee'uns go hungry."
[2A-01] "It's a hard young man ye are, to be sure, and ought to be kinder to your elders.  As for the Bugbear, you'll find him in the cairn. When you're done with him, come back here and we'll pay you what we can."
[2B-01] "Ah, bless you my boy; I knew you for a game lad the moment I saw you.  As for the Bugbear, you'll find him in the cairn. When you're done with him, come back here and we'll pay you what we can."
[2C-01] "Listen, lad, there's nothin' I'd rather do than sit around and sing songs by the fire, but don't you have a Bugbear to kill?"
[2D-01] "A blessing on your head and all your tasks, young fellow.  We should have figured it was ole Vinters pulling that stunt. We passed the hat and collected all the silver we could; here's some pieces for all your troubles.  Take 'em and be well."
[2E-01] "Well, I had my misgivings when we met, but you're a good fellow after all. We should have figured it was ole Vinters pulling that stunt.  Here's some pieces of silver to line your pockets.  I'm sorry it's not more, but we've hungry mouths to feed, and precious little to do it with."
[2F-01] "Look who it is. The cock o' the walk ye are now, I'll bet, and just as nasty to your elders. Still, a deal's a deal, so here's your blood money, you spawn, and I hope you choke on it!"
[30-01] "My thanks again young man!"
[31-01] "And the gift of gab, Old Timer. So, tell me where might I find a bit of silver and I'll be out of your hair.  What's left of it."
[32-01] "Sorry, Granddad.  I didn't expect to find you here, or frighten you when I did. I'm only out looking for a bit of silver to line my pockets."
[33-01] "So it's a bit of killing you want done, eh?  Fair enough, but I should warn you, my blade doesn't come cheap."
[34-01] "I know what it means to be hungry, and worse it is for a child.  So: a fair price for a fair piece of work, and it's a bargain."
[35-01] "Well thanks for nothing you crazy old bastard!"
[36-01] "Be careful, young sir! There is a ferocious Bugbear on the loose. Grrrr. I'd best leave be if I were you; I mean. I mean you'd best leave if you were you.  Oh, you know what I mean; you should leave Houton an' never come back!"
[37-01] "Don't worry old man; if I were you, then there'd be two rambling idiots in this Broch.  Wait, if I were you, there'd only be one rambling idiot in this...no no, wait... If I were, no... Oh never mind!  Either way, I'm not planning on moving in here... I'll be gone soon enough."
[38-01] "Ye've come looking for my boy Ogan, haven't you!?  Of course ye have.  But it's gone he is, for he's the one, the Chosen One, who'll free the fair Princess from cruel bondage.  And what do ye suppose that means to a poor old woman like me?  Why, everything, that's what.  For he's promised to come back, my Ogan, and take me away from this awful place and give me a proper house, with glass in the windows, floors of wood, and a larder so full we'll never know hunger again.  So when you see him, tell him his mother loves him."
[39-01] "Let me know when you've found my Ogan."
[3A-01] "Oh no... tell me it isn't true... killed. I hope you avenged my boy!"
[3B-01] "You avenged my Ogan!  Thank you. Now please leave a mother to grieve."
[3C-01] "You avenged my Ogan!  Thank you, thank you. I knew you were a good man. May your future journeys continue in good health. Here this was a charm Ogan gave me said it'd bring me luck, why don't you take it?"
[3D-01] "I've got some bad news, I'm afraid... I saw your boy Ogan, or what was left of him."
[3E-01] "I've got some bad news, I'm afraid... your boy was slain, murdered by a Trow."
[3F-01] "Of course. They were coming after me next and I had to defend myself."
[40-01] "I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you.  But I want you to know, the ones that killed him, I cut them down where they stood!"
[41-01] "Well now, you must be the Bard that everyone's been talking about, the fellow with the spider made of lightning.  It's honored I am to have you in my shop, sir, and happy to facilitate all your arms and armament needs.  Swords, bows, or armor, everything here is first rate and for sale.  Terms are cash in advance, in full, all sales final, with no letters of credit, lay-aways or I.O.U.s.  We do have a buy-back policy, if you buy it, don't bring it back. So, look over what you want and I'll be happy to cover the finer points of any item I have in stock, but remember the golden rule: you break it, you buy it."
[42-01] "It's a fact: a warrior's only as tough as his weakest armor.  Plenty of folks have bought the cheap stuff, but none of them have been repeat customers... if you take my meaning."
[43-01] "My armor's some of the best; dire boar hide, butterfly skinned and double cured, with adjustable suede straps and cast iron buckles, tough enough to take a hit, but light enough to keep you fast.  I'd be willing to part with this item for a very reasonable price."
[44-01] "If it were me, I'd've gone for a little more oomph in me armor, but it's your skin, isn't it.  Like I said, it'll keep you fast, but there's no runnin' away from an arrow."
[45-01] "Now you're talkin' leather armor.  Reinforced with hammer-forged iron studding and all-weather bronze buckles cast by the sea-folk of the Western Shores.  Like all my leathers it's fully articulated for comfort and ease of movement and will keep you standing when others leave you bleeding, so it's well worth my one-time, profit-shaving price."
[46-01] "A smart man you are, and one who knows the true value of his own life. I've always said there is no reason to try and save money when it comes to armor, for you can't take it with you."
[47-01] "This is where we have our close combat weaponry.  When you're battling a foe up close and personal, you don't want to skimp on your instrument of battle.  In most cases not the best man, but the best weapon walks away to tell the tale."
[48-01] "Like to do some fancy dual weapon fighting? Then You've got to have a dirk.  This one comes straight from Finstown and features a fully fullered ricasso and a ring guard for precise blade control.  A thrust through the visor or chink in the armor and I guarantee your man is going down.  Now, that kind of weapon doesn't come cheap, but I'd be happy to sell you this particular item for a first rate price."
[49-01] "Very good, fine sir. I'm not a fighting man, but having an extra weapon to stick it to your foes can never be a bad thing, can it?"
[4A-01] "Ah, the mighty flail.  Six pounds of pain on a chain, with a quarter-sawn hexagonal hickory shaft and a jointed head of drop-forged iron that's been tempered in the ice-cold blood of captured fin-folk.  Tricky to wield, but score a hit and it will crush armor and break bones, and I'm willing to let you have it for a pittance."
[4B-01] "Very, very nice choice sir.  I pity the man who encounters this flail with you at the other end of it."
[4C-01] "Now here's a piece o' hurt that'll let you swagger down any street and never want for safety.  The Claymore, or as I like to call it, the Emporer of Evisceration.  It's three cubits long with three-quarter length parallel fullers, a barrel-cut two handed grip, and balanced at the hilt for better leverage in short cuts or long swings.  This weapon definitely covers a lot of ground and what it lacks in speed it more than makes up for in pure stopping power.  Now it just so happens that due to a slight accounting error I'm overstocked on this particular item so I'd be willing to let one go for a ridiculous price."
[4D-01] "Ah, the claymore, I must say I'm impressed.  To be honest I took you for a broadsword man, but it takes a fine warrior to handle such a fine weapon."
[4E-01] "If you ask me, there's no better place to battle a deadly foe than from a distance.  The more you spend on this ranged weaponry will not only put you further from your enemy, but also further from your own tombstone."
[4F-01] "You're looking to drop 'em from a distance? That's a longbow.  These are the finest kiln-dried white ash bows from the weapon shops of Kirkwall, the choice of Sylvan Assassins and until recently banned in four provinces.  Pull's preset to fifty pounds and guaranteed to put a four-ounce shaft through a two inch plank from fifty paces.  Believe me, these babies pack a punch that your enemies will not forget and they are definitely worth every last bit of the silver that I'm asking."
[50-01] "Excellent choice my friend for the longbow is often the key to a long life.  Use it in good health."
[51-01] "Peekin' at my map, are you?  I can tell you this much: it's as old as the hills an' chock-full of danger and delight.  The fellow I had it from said there's plenty of frights to make things hot, plenty of X's markin' the spot."
[52-01] "I'm filthy stinkin' rich I am! All that silver for a scrap of a map I had off a wizened old bugger for the price of a piece o' bread!  Well, so long and farewell, good sir.  I'm off to Dounby to spend me days drunk as a lord and ticklin' every lass I can lay hand to.  Ah, bless you, sir!  Bless you and goodbye!!"
[53-01] "Watch out for Sheriff Rucky, he's a dog without shame."
[54-01] "The world is coming to an end and you want to talk?"
[55-01] "Sorry."
[56-01] "Pardon Me."
[57-01] "Hey stranger... no time to talk now I'm late for a date with the widow Macrary!"
[58-01] "Excuse me Sir, I don't mean to cause a panic, but...  WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!!"
[59-01] "Excuse me."
[5A-01] "Sorry."
[5B-01] "Top of the morning to ya."
[5C-01] "I can't talk to you right now.  I'm trying to find this guy I owe an apology to."
[5D-01] "Sorry."
[5E-01] "Pardon Me."
[5F-01] "Beware the Finfolk, some say they are sorcerors!"
[60-01] "Most of the village has been destroyed but at least the Drunken Rat is still open for business if ya know what I mean."
[61-01] "Pardon Me."
[62-01] "Sorry"
[63-01] "Don't go near Sheriff Rucky's Jail, it's been run over with Kunal Trow!"
[64-01] "Excuse me."
[65-01] "Sorry"
[66-01] "What you staring at? Never seen a Firbolg before?"
[67-01] "Sorry"
[68-01] "Excuse me."
[69-01] "Sorry! Oh hold on a bit... Sorry?  You been bumpin into folks all over the village!  Enough is enough!  I think you owe ME an apology!"
[6A-01] "You will become very familiar with this tone you aimless oaf, for I demand an apology... and I will get one!"
[6B-01] "Ok, apology accepted. Try to be more careful in the future!"
[6C-01] "There you are!  Remember me?  I'm the patient villager you owe an apology to."
[6D-01] "So we meet again.   I'm thinking you still owe me an apology."
[6E-01] "Look, you. I'll give you one more chance to apologize before I knock your teeth in!"
[6F-01] "Hey... you... I won't drop this... You'd better apologize."
[70-01] "Oh how kind of you.  Can we be buddies now?"
[71-01] "All I'll owe you is a face full of knuckles if you take that tone with me again."
[72-01] "Well excuse me, I'll be more careful in the future."
[73-01] "Ah yes. You know, I am sorry... sorry I didn't pummel you earlier."
[74-01] "You know, it's going to be hard to beg for an apology without a bleeding tongue!"
[75-01] "Yeah?  And I'll give you one last chance to get a life, while you're actually still living."
[76-01] "I suggest you drop it, before I drop you.  Right here, right now."
[77-01] "All right already!  I apologize! I apologize!  It's either that or kill you, and I just cleaned my sword."
[78-01] "Quit while you're ahead... and while you still have one."
[79-01] "Moooooo"
[7A-01] "BAAAAAAA"
[7B-01] "Oink Oink"
[7C-01] "Cluck Cluck Cluck"
[7D-01] "Moooooo"
[7E-01] "Baaaaaaa"
[7F-01] "Oink Oink"
[80-01] "Cluck Cluck Cluck"
[81-01] "What's the password?"
[82-01] "Go away!!!!"
[83-01] "Nope!"
[84-01] "Get Lost!"
[85-01] "That's not it!"
[86-01] "That's not a word!"
[87-01] "Is not."
[88-01] "What's it mean?"
[89-01] "Oooh.  I'm real scared."
[8A-01] "No."
[8B-01] "Clear off, you idiot!"
[8C-01] "You already tried that one! Now go away!"
[8D-01] "So Bannafeet must have... hey who are you? You aren't supposed to be here!"
[8E-01] "Fiddlesnarf!"
[8F-01] "Finkelrult."
[90-01] "Houton."
[91-01] "Open Sesame?"
[92-01] "Hootsnock?"
[93-01] "Is too."
[94-01] "Is too."
[95-01] "It means, open up this door before I break it down and beat you to death!"
[96-01] "I swear I'll do it.  I will! Look, are you going to let me in or aren't you?"
[97-01] "Please?"
[98-01] "Which one of you bloody heathens is Ketill Swart?  Bannafeet sent me here to set you free."
[99-01] "Already I've been reduced to flipping switches by order of criminals....great."
[9A-01] "Hey, who doesn't?"
[9B-01] "Yeah, I haven't had this much fun since I was almost barbequed by a giant rat."
[9C-01] "Yeah, sure next time, yeah."
[9D-01] "It's a long story.... maybe you'd like to have a seat while I tell you all about it... ...in the middle of a kunal trow infested jail. Let's get out of here before I regret what I've done... more than I already do."
[9E-01] "Yeah, sure. You draw me a picture, I'll draw your blood."
[9F-01] "Whoops!"
[A0-01] "I can't argue with that.  If I'm here trying to free the likes of you, I must be the village idiot."
[A1-01] "Hey, now that's a low blow."
[A2-01] "I'm Ketill Swart."
[A3-01] "To hell with them!  I'm Ketill."
[A4-01] "We'll never convince you which one of us are telling the truth, so just flip those switches in the order I tell you and it will open the doors."
[A5-01] "How long do you think we have! Flip those switches."
[A6-01] "Pull that one!!!!"
[A7-01] "No No No!"
[A8-01] "Pull that one!"
[A9-01] "No, not that one!"
[AA-01] "Pull that one!"
[AB-01] "No, not that one!"
[AC-01] "Yes, that is the one!"
[AD-01] "No! That won't help!"
[AE-01] "That's the one!"
[AF-01] "Oh no! Not that one!"
[B0-01] "I don't know why you did this, but I'm most thankful."
[B1-01] "Ahhhhh, what's wrong with you! We told you exactly what to do!  Do you want us to draw you a picture?"
[B2-01] "See how easy that was!"
[B3-01] "Great, I'm stuck in this hellhole and the only person that can free me is the village idiot."
[B4-01] "It's not like I'm asking you to solve the mystery of flight.  All brawn and no brain.  The Widow MacRary may date you after all."
[B5-01] "More to her than to you. Look, just try and listen to me this time."
[B6-01] "No he's not!  I'm Ketill Swart!"
[B7-01] "What's it matter which one of us is Ketill?  Set us all free!"
[B8-01] "But we've been watching closely and we know the order to flip them."
[B9-01] "Open the gate, you daft bugger, before I die of old age!"
[BA-01] "Pull that one!!!!"
[BB-01] "No no no. No!"
[BC-01] "Mmmmm, It might be that one!"
[BD-01] "Mmmmm, It might be that one!"
[BE-01] "No.... I think so, try switch 1."
[BF-01] "I think that's it!"
[C0-01] "Uhhhh, I think that's the one!"
[C1-01] "Uhhhh. It doesn't seem right."
[C2-01] "That's it!...oh no it isn't! Try another."
[C3-01] "That might be it!"
[C4-01] "See how easy that was! Thank you, thank you."
[C5-01] "Like hell!  I'm Ketill Swart."
[C6-01] "Yes, the Sheriff has these doors rigged with some bizarre 6 switch combination lock that only he is supposed to know."
[C7-01] "Come on already!  I've got a date with the Widow MacRary."
[C8-01] "Pull that one!!!!"
[C9-01] "No No No!"
[CA-01] "No, not that one!!"
[CB-01] "Pull that one!"
[CC-01] "Yes, yes.... Pull that one!"
[CD-01] "Bah!"
[CE-01] "No, that isn't it!"
[CF-01] "There you go, pull it and let us free!"
[D0-01] "No, the last one is lever 3."
[D1-01] "There you go, pull it and let us free!"
[D2-01] "One good turn deserves another; I'll pay you back when next we meet!"
[D3-01] "Good dog!"
[D4-01] "In Neversdale amongst the brush -With roots down deep and branches lush - A tall round trunk of wizened wood -    Divides bough from earth, as well it should. For it's not a bush, we must confess.          It's something else, we'll let you guess.      And when you see it, when you know,    Play a song and off you'll go.                      In safety and in perfect health,                  And with, perhaps, a bit more wealth."
[D5-01] "Ow!"
[D6-01] "Hey that hurt!"
[D7-01] "Ahhh!!!  Don't kill me!  Don't kill me!"
[D8-01] "Please, don't kill me. Please! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone.  Oh, I'm bleeding. I think you broke my arm. Ah! Is that a tooth!? I just spit out a tooth! Oh, not another tooth!"
[D9-01] "Oh, look at me! Look at me! No! Don't look at me! Oh, hell, do what you want! I don't care! Go ahead and look! I'm not a bugbear!  I'm just a dirty old bastard running about in a smelly old rug with a bucket for a head! Go ahead! Take all my silver! I don't need it anyway! I was saving it all up for a date with the Widow MacRary, until she found out I'm still living with my mother! Now she won't even speak to me! You know what else!? I'm forty-two and still a virgin! How pathetic is that!?  Ahhh, just kill me! Please! Just get it over with!"
[DA-01] "Oh, leave me alone!  Just take the silver and go!"
[DB-01] "You're just pathetic!"
[DC-01] "So, you're the fellow what's been chasin' through Houton with your rats an' lightnin' spiders, eh?"
[DD-01] "Now there's no cause to be tryin' that attitude with me. I'm for collecting the taxes and keepin' the peace. I have enough problems with the Kunal Trow around here; I don't need to be worrying about the likes of you."
[DE-01] "That's fine. My job is to be keepin' the peace, collectin' the taxes, and fending off the Kunal Trow. Respect that, and you're welcome to stay in Houton as long as you please. Otherwise you'll find yourself in my jail."
[DF-01] "Well now, you must be the daft idiot what's been chasin' through Houton with his rats an' lightnin' spiders!"
[E0-01] "Shut up! Ketill Swart's a back-stabbin', thieving rogue what took me half a year to catch, an' now you've up and set 'im free, and it's a good bet he's gone to ground in Neversdale forest!"
[E1-01] "Well, just you head outta town and get him back, and be quick about it! Go recapture the blackguard or you'll never be welcome in Houton again!"
[E2-01] "Hang you for a meddlin' fool!  It's one thing to be frightenin' the widows and killin' the rats, but you've up an' set loose that pig-stealin', back-stabbing Ketill Swart."
[E3-01] "Well, laddie, he's takin' to hiding in the Neversdale forest, and you're the one that's going after him."
[E4-01] "So, just you head outta town and bring him to me.  But don't come back here without him."
[E5-01] "I told you to bring me Ketill!  Now get off your arse and get after him!"
[E6-01] "So you swine!  Happy to see me?  Just you try runnin' again and it's fodder for the finfolk you'll be."
[E7-01] "Reward? You're lucky I don't throw you in jail."
[E8-01] "What?  You back again!  Go kill a rat, you rogue; it's all you're good for."
[E9-01] "You know, you keep comin' round here, and pretty soon I'll let you stay.  Permanent.  Now be off with you."
[EA-01] "Well now, fancy running into ye again."
[EB-01] "Welcome to the Kirk of Houton young man. We can lay our hands for a healing and blessing should you feel inclined to make a small donation."
[EC-01] "Care to make a donation my son?"
[BD-02] "Don't worry sheriff; they don't bite. Much."
[BE-02] "All I'm after is songs and silver, and I've no mind to break the laws in gettin' them."
[BF-02] "Look here, Sheriff..."
[C0-02] "Is there a prob...?"
[EA-02] "Interesting."
[32-05] "You've been hunting grouse I see. Well,  If you enjoy the hunt, you should stop by my hunting shack some time. I own some land that's ripe with Game. Feel free to come by any time, I'll mark it on your map."
[1A-07] "AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
[FB-09] "Beer beer beer tiddly beer beer beer.  A long time ago, way back in history, when all there was to drink was nothing but cups of tea, along came a man by the name of Charlie Mops, and he invented a wonderful drink and he made it out of hops.  Hey!  He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, and to his praises we shall always sing.  Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer tiddly beer beer beer.  The Drunken Rat, the Aiken Drum, the Trowies Pub as well, one thing you can be sure of, it's Charlie's beer they sell.  So all ye lads and lasses at eleven O'clock ye stop.

[06-0A] "AAAAHHHHHHHHAHHAHHH"
[0E-0A] "What are you doing!  Stop that right now! Why are you breaking my barrels?"
[0F-0A] "Well, I can't have you breaking those barrels, I haven't sold them yet.  I could however offer you some incentive to practice your hobby elsewhere."
[10-0A] "If that's your attitude then off with you! Come back when your in a better mood and maybe we can talk."
[11-0A] "The more broken barrels in the world, the more people need to buy my new ones. You just practice your hobby, and I'll pay you a bounty for every barrel you break."
[12-0A] "No catch, just keep smashing barrels and I'll start setting aside silver for you for every new barrel I sell to replace the ones you've broken.  Come back here any time and I'll make good on my promise."
[13-0A] "Well they do, It took me all day to make those. I don't mind if you break them after they're sold, but don't destroy my inventory before I've sold em!"
[14-0A] "It's a rude man you are! Come back when you're in a mood to be a bit more civil and we can talk."
[15-0A] "Fine with me, you just keep smashing barrels and I'll start setting aside silver for you for every new barrel I sell to replace the ones you've broken. Come back here any time and I'll make good on my promise and pay you what I owe."
[16-0A] "Look, if you aren't going to smash barrels, there's no reason to come back and talk to me. Get out there and earn some money!"
[17-0A] "You're really not very good at this are you?  Oh well, here's your cut."
[18-0A] "Business is picking up, and I'm sure I have you to thank. Here you go!"
[19-0A] "My business is so good I'm opening up a second shop in Dounby!  Thanks to you I'll be the richest man in town!  It was a pleasure doing business with you, maybe I'll see you again!"
[1A-0A] "What are you doing back here?  You owe me for the barrels you broke! If your in a mood to talk we can discuss a way for you to repay me."
[1B-0A] "If you want to get your money back, go and destroy the barrels I've already sold.  I'll set aside silver from every new barrel I sell to replace the ones you've broken. If my sales are good, we both stand to profit."
[1C-0A] "I look forward to a long and profitable relationship!  See you again soon."
[1D-0A] "Sorry, but breaking barrels is one of my hobbies."
[1E-0A] "I don't need any incentive, breaking barrels is just one of those things I enjoy. So back off before I forget the barrels and start on you."
[1F-0A] "Incentive? Now you're speaking my language!  What did you have in mind?"
[20-0A] "Sounds too easy, what's the catch?"
[21-0A] "Well, I don't know if I trust you, but since I plan on smashing barrels anyways it doesn't matter now does it. You've got a deal."
[22-0A] "I didn't know these belonged to anyone."
[23-0A] "I don't know how to break this to you, but you're a horrible barrel maker. One swing and they burst into a thousand pieces, I mean what kind of shoddy craftsmanship is that anyways?"
[24-0A] "Okay, I'll lay off these, but if I see a barrel somewhere else, I will, of course, be forced to destroy it."
[25-0A] "I won't hold my breath old man, but if I'm back in the area, I'll come look you up."
[26-0A] "I'm not in the mood to talk to a bloody incompetent Barrel maker such as yourself."
[27-0A] "Oh all right... Let's hear what you have to say."
[28-0A] "I like the way you think old man, it's dodgy business practices like yours that have made this land great.  I'll be happy to help out however I can."
[29-0A] "Sure, as soon as I hand over silver, everyone is my friend..."
[37-0A] "Who is she?  She's beautiful.  I'll take the amulet old man and what were you saying about a trow?"
[38-0A] "That remains to be seen. Out with it man, what do you want from me?"
[39-0A] "I thought so. What is it you want? Something dangerous no doubt?"
[3A-0A] "Ah hah I knew it was something like that! I'm not joining anything but I will take your advice and find this trow. Oh and I'll have that amulet as well if you're still offering it."
[3B-0A] "This amulet was made by a powerful sorceress, it can summon her spirit to heal yer wounds in battle. Ye'll need adderstones to provide the necessary mystical power, if you like you can even use multiple stones for even greater effect. Here laddie, try it out."
[3C-0A] "Ye wound me laddie."
[3D-0A] "Ye've got it all wrong. Look my boy...oh ok... I do want something from ya."
[3E-0A] "No no nothing like that. Ye see I belong to an ancient order, we've travelled the land for years now seeking men such as yerself to..."
[3F-0A] "O' course lad, of course. Here ye go and don't forget, the trow is in the Fairyhaunt woods, goes by the name of Bannafeet."
[40-0A] "Find him in the Fairyhaunt woods... Bannafeet be his name. He can teach ye magic enough to impress any lass."
[41-0A] "Slay me Bard and you'll never learn that magic you're after. Wouldn't you like a little something to even the odds when facing wily fellows like meself?"
[42-0A] "Sheriff Rucky keeps a jail in the forest.  Inside is a prisoner by the name of Ketill Swart. Spring him free for me and you'll get your song.  The good news is that there are no guards around.  The bad news is that they abandoned their posts to avoid a tribe of Kunal Trow that've claimed the building as their own.  Once you make it past their patrols you'll need to say \"fiddlesnarf\" at the door to be let in. When he's free, come back here and I'll teach you some magic. Fair enough?"
[43-0A] "What are you doing here when Ketill's still in jail!? Off with you!"
[44-0A] "Oh, thank you! I wagered Sheriff Rucky that Ketill wouldn't be locked up for more than a day, I sent the Kunal Trow to free him but they decided to take over the jail and claim it as their own. I thought for sure I'd lose but now you come along and win the bet for me! Well, a deal's a deal, so here's your song."
[45-0A] "HA HA HO HO HA HA HA  HO."
[46-0A] "Very funny, very funny.  Let me return the favor by throwing you in a hole... six feet deep!"
[47-0A] "I'll teach you some respect."
[48-0A] "I'm listening. For now."
[49-0A] "No not really but it's a start. I don't relish chasing you around this forest so I'll do what you ask... but you had better keep your end of the bargain or I'll make you wish you had."
[4A-0A] "When I asked you to free Ketill, this was not exactly what I meant."
[4B-0A] "Heh, well, I guess you do have a point there.  Are you sure you've not got a wee bit o' Trow in you?  With that attitude, we could be related."
[4C-0A] "Technically he's no longer in Jail. I did what you wanted... In a manner of speaking."
[65-0A] "What I'm looking for is at the bottom of a well huh? I'm going to make Bannafeet pay for this wild goose chase."
[67-0A] "I see ye've picked up some more magic along the way. If it's even more power ye'd like, then ye ought to pay a visit to my brother Bodb in Kirkwall."
[68-0A] "Oh no, he's not really my brother you see, but a member of my order."
[69-0A] "Now lad, ye've only benefited from the knowledge I've given ye in the past."
[6A-0A] "Seek out Bodb in Kirkwall, I'll speak no more of it, good luck to ya Laddie."
[6B-0A] "Yeah, yeah, yeah...oh yeah... I'm sure its all a big coincidence."
[6C-0A] "Your Brother eh? He anything like you?"
[6D-0A] "Of course he is."
[6E-0A] "That's what worries me."
[79-0A] "Ummm maybe we shouldn't aggravate him."
[7A-0A] "Damn! Well, Bannafeet has to admit Ketill's not in jail any longer."
[7B-0A] "So.... About the magic tune you owe me..."
[7C-0A] "Magic Tune!!?  You kill my friend Ketill, steal all the loot from his hide out, and still have the nerve to come back here and shake me down for the magic tune.  Are you SURE you are not part Trow?"
[7D-0A] "Loot from his hideout? What hideout?  No one mentioned nothing about a hideout."
[7E-0A] "You didn't... oh... never mind... well I really must rush away.  I know I owe you a song, I promise to pay up next time we meet.  I am just too overcome with grief for the loss of my friend Ketill. I'm sure his treasure... I mean his hideout will need some looking after. I really must be going..."
[7F-0A] "Hey! Damn I hate Trow. Well, since I can't follow him, I better figure out where Ketill's hideout is, in a hurry."
[A1-0A] "Kirkwall has been revealed on the World Map."
[A2-0A] "Neversdale has been revealed on the World Map."
[A4-0A] "Well look who it is. I've been waiting for you..."
[AB-0A] "Why you're the hero of Houton Bard! You chased off the Kunal Trow that had overrun the forest and done for that villain Ketill Swart as well!"
[AC-0A] "Reward? I'll just hang on to the reward money. I'm  glad Ketill is dead, but I still have to pay off my bet with that crafty trow.  That Ketill though, he was supposed to have stolen a great fortune, perhaps you could find it and take it for yerself. He made his hideout in the Forest of Neversdale, a dangerous place no doubt but no barrier to the likes of you I'm certain."
[AD-0A] "Yes, of course I am.  I knew that something had to be done to free the good people of Houton from the clutches of evil!  Now about my reward..."
[AE-0A] "Now about my reward..."
[AF-0A] "Reward? You're lucky I don't throw you in jail."
[B0-0A] "That's telling him Sheriff!"
[B1-0A] "Shut yer bloody gob!"
[B2-0A] "So no reward then?"
[B3-0A] "Out with you!"
[B4-0A] "Things have been quiet around here lately and we've got you to thank for it!"
[C9-0A] "Treasure Map"
[EB-0A] "All items priced as marked. No returns. All Sales are final."
[EC-0A] "Welcome back.  What can I do for you?"
[50-0B] "The Next Morning..."
[76-0B] "Before ye head down there and face that huge rat I'd  like to be sure that ye know yer business. Would ye like me to teach you a few wee things that'll help ye get the best o' any foes ye might encounter?"
[79-0B] "Ye've already proven that ye know how to move around and attack with yer weapon. Let's talk a wee bit about Jumpin'."
[7A-0B] "Press the [7C-00] button."
[7B-0B] "Press the [7E-00] button."
[7C-0B] "Press the [7D-00] button."
[7D-0B] "Press the [7B-00] button."
[7E-0B] "Press the Y button."
[7F-0B] "Press the A button."
[80-0B] "Press the B button."
[81-0B] "Good job lad! Ye already know how to attack but let's talk about defending yerself."
[82-0B] "That was great boyo, ye'll notice that instead o' holding down the button ye'll have to time yer defense to the enemy's attack."
[83-0B] "Now laddie let's teach ye how to play that lute of yers and make some magic."
[84-0B] "To play your lute first ye'll have to equip it."
[85-0B] "Hold down the L1 button."
[86-0B] "Press the L1 button."
[87-0B] "Hold down the L2 button."
[88-0B] "Press the L2 button."
[89-0B] "Hold down the R1 button."
[8A-0B] "Press the R1 button."
[8B-0B] "Hold down the R2 button."
[8C-0B] "Press the R2 button."
[8D-0B] "Press the left trigger."
[8E-0B] "Press the right trigger."
[8F-0B] "Ye'll notice several options... since you only have a lute ye'll select that for now."
[90-0B] "Now ye've got your lute equipped."
[91-0B] "Ye'll see several choices, these are the different types of beasties ye'll eventually be able to summon. For now let's summon that spider I taught ye about."
[92-0B] "That'll open up the menu displaying yer elemental beasties. Ye've only got one option now so select that one."

[96-0B] "Good luck against that Rat my boy!"
[97-0B] "I know what I'm doing old man, I've no need for advice from the likes of you!"

[99-0B] "Of course I know how to walk around... and jumping? I know how to jump!"
[9A-0B] "What? What are you on about? What button? You're completely insane aren't you? Ya know, I ran into this other guy once, he kept talking about mice that I couldn't see."
[9B-0B] "There... I jumped wasn't that amazing?"
[9C-0B] "Now I'm blocking pretend blows, I hope you appreciate what I'm going through here and reward me sufficiently."
[9D-0B] "Of course I have to time it... How else am I going to block anything?"
[9E-0B] "What? Does my name not mean anything to you? The Bard? Did you not see me summon that rat a few moments ago?"
[9F-0B] "You're not listening to a word I'm saying are you?"
[A0-0B] "Well that was useful at least. Finally."
[A1-0B] "Great... does that trick work on you as well?"
[A2-0B] "In the future I'm going to have to learn how to dodge these mysterious old man types."

[6F-0E] "Welcome back. What can I get for you?"
[70-0E] "You've a fine eye to be sure. That's some of my own house vintage. It was a favorite of my dearly departed husband. I believe he even had a glass of it in hand when he passed away."
[71-0E] "We get that stuff in from Kirkwall, I hear the fella who brews it is some kind of a hero. Lost a few limbs and turned to brewing when he couldn't fight any longer."
[72-0E] "Quite strong drink you've got there. We import it from the quaint village of Stromness over on the western shores. I hear it's lovely there this time of year, perhaps you should go for a visit."
[73-0E] "Pig's Meade? Well if you've no money then I suppose you drink what you can. And here I thought you had a little more class than that."
[74-0E] "I hope I'll be seeing you around."
[75-0E] "It was a pleasure to serve you."
[76-0E] "I hope you enjoyed that."
[AF-0E] "The Bard having slain the random wolf found that it had digested not only the contents of a small treasury but also various household goods... wait am I reading that correctly? That can't be right."
[B0-0E] "You'd be surprised. I find all kinds of thing inside these beasties. Did I ever tell you about the time I killed this rat and out popped an entire chest..."
[B1-0E] "Well, I'm just going to skip those passages in the future."
[B2-0E] "What? That's a major source of income! You cheap, good for nothing horse's..."
[B3-0E] "*Ahem* And so the Bard continued on his journey..."

[55-12] "And then the Bard looted the chest which contained the Widow's most precious... Wait a minute... Did I read that properly? You're stealing from her?"
[56-12] "I wouldn't call it stealing exactly... People leave all kinds of things in chests and they never seem to object when I help myself. Think of it as a public service, who knows how cluttered these chests might become if I didn't do my part to help clean them out."
[57-12] "In hindsight, I'm surprised it took the Bard this long to get his hands on Mary's Chest."
[62-12] "Hmmm... Let me think...no."

[6D-14] "And then the Bard used his newly learned magical abilities to defeat the Giant Rat. Or at least that's what he should have done."
