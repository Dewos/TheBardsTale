[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[31-08] "As the Bard strolled along the riverbanks, he came across two arguing Trow.  Or was it one Trow arguing with a drunken wine barrel?  In any case, the Bard found himself caught in the middle... One of his true talents."
[32-08] "Hey!  Help!  Help!  He's going to beat me for no reason!  Help!  Call him off!"
[33-08] "No Reason! You drank half the wine and tried to drink the other half before I got to you. You sir! Grab him and haul him out, then you can hold him while I skin the little thief!"
[34-08] "Don't believe him, kind sir!  I only had a wee sip while he was tryin' to figure out how to get us all across the river.  Maybe you could do it for us. Figure out how to get us across and I'll let you in on a secret worth knowin'."
[35-08] "So... we'll just all get in this little boat and row across."
[36-08] "Well there is a bit of a hitch, the boat's only big enough to hold you and one of us or the barrel at one time."
[37-08] "So you've got to choose how to get us across, but whatever you do, don't take the wine and leave me alone with Chubnik or he'll beat me like a dirty rug!"
[38-08] "Hang you, Piskey!  It's the wine I'm worried about!  Don't take me and leave him here with the wine, or he'll drink it all!"
[39-08] "I'll see what I can do.  You there, little one.  Come out of the barrel while I figure this out.  Chubnik won't hurt you while I'm here."
[3A-08] "No! Aren't you listening! Don't you care! Take the barrel, and by the time you come back, I won't be punch drunk... I'll just be punched!"
[3B-08] "I told you I'm not leaving that drunken Trow alone with the wine. Now leave off and do somethin' else!"
[3C-08] "What! Not him! I said the wine! Leave me here with him and he'll beat me like a red-headed step child!"
[3D-08] "Don't you leave him with that wine!"
[3E-08] "Bon Voy... Bon Voy... So long, friend!"
[3F-08] "You silly sorry simpleton!  I TOLD you he'd drink my wine!  Ach!  And to think we was goin' to show you the secret path through this forest!"
[40-08] "Hang on. Look, sorry about your wine, but you can't  blame me 'cause he's a souse."
[41-08] "You're right about that. I knew Piskey was going to be trouble. I should've strangled him in his sleep last night. So I'll tell you what: you pay me oh, say all your silvers for that barrel o' wine, and I'll show you the secret trail through the woods. Deal?"
[42-08] "Are you kidding? All of my silver for a barrel of sour wine!"
[43-08] "Done!"
[44-08] "Suit yourself."
[45-08] "Good riddance, you git!"
[46-08] "Oh, all right. I'll pay. You chiseler."
[47-08] "There you are, boyo. Don't say I didn't warn you. Oh, yeah. Thanks for the silver!"
[48-08] "Don't leave the wine all alone, you'll hurt its feelings!  I promise if you leave me with it I won't have but a sip or two!  Oh, please..."
[49-08] "Now you can sober up!  If you need something to drink, try the river!  Hah!"
[4A-08] "Well now, aren't you the clever one. You got us across and none of us the worse for wear.  I'll show you a way through the forest."
[4B-08] "There you go, lad!  Have fun stormin' the forest!"
[4C-08] "Hah!  Chubnik! Catch me if you can, you old goat!"
[4D-08] "Come back here, you!"
[4E-08] "Having left the two trow behind, the Bard entered the hidden forest."
[4F-08] "Prepare to die! I am Ogan! The chosen one! Nothing will stop me from my quest to save the princess and drive the evil from this land. Have at you!"
[50-08] "And what have we here!?  Another Chosen One off to save the princess?"
[51-08] "Brave talk for someone who picks on crazed half-wits with more bravery than sense. I assure you that you will soon join him."
[52-08] "I'm just passing through my friend...just passing through."
[53-08] "Ah, a coward is it?  Wise choice, friend.  But you'll not be goin' anywhere with all them fine items you're carryin'! Oy, lads! I've got a live one! Come and see!"
[54-08] "By the way, your mum says hello."
[55-08] "With a great deal of skill, or perhaps a tremendous amount of luck, the Bard disposed of the murderous Trow.  With a bit more luck, he may even come out the other end of the forest without an arrow coming out the other end of his head."
[56-08] "Always the optimist."
[57-08] "Come and get me, you meanderin' moron!"
[58-08] "Ketill! Quit cowering up there like the frightened rodent that you are! Come out and fight!"
[59-08] "Ah, your mother's a Firbolg and your old man's a Trow!"
[5A-08] "You don't want to make me come up there!"
[5B-08] "Save yer singin' for the sheep, you croonin' coward!"
[5C-08] "Come on, you pansy!"
[5D-08] "No more!  No more!  Don't kill me!  I was only kiddin' about your sister. I'll come with you."
[5E-08] "Put your hands behind your back."
[5F-08] "Now what!?  You won't be tryin' any of them preversions will you?"
[60-08] "I'm making sure you can't run away again, or if you'd prefer, I could just cut you off at the knees."
[61-08] "But you're the one who let me go. And now you're takin' me back? Are you bored out of your skull or just wrong in the head?"
[62-08] "Ow!  Stop hitting me!"
[63-08] "Would you prefer I start stabbing you? Now shut your mouth and come with me."
[64-08] "With Ketill in tow, the Bard moved on hoping to avoid the Trow and bring his prisoner back to Houton."
[65-08] "What are you doing?  The Kunal Trow are lurkin' everywhere!  They'll kill you soon as look at you.  Untie me, and we might make a match, the pair of us."
[66-08] "Maybe if you'd shut the hell up, we could get away without them hearing us."
[67-08] "Well now. What have we here? I don't know you. But Ketill my clandestine companion when was the last time we saw each other?"
[68-08] "Well now, let's see.  I was on my way to Houton and..."
[69-08] "Oh wait...I remember...yes... it was... when you pilfered my prized possession, my exquisite Eagle Charm."
[6A-08] "Twasn't me, Fnarf, I swear!  I've never even seen your eagle charm.  But I'd be happy to keep an eye out for it.  In fact, if you could talk this gentleman into lettin' me go, I'll go look for it right now!"
[6B-08] "Twasn't me, Fnarf!  It was this beggar right here who stole it!  I was bringin' him back to you when he knocked me over the head, took it from me person and tied me up."
[6C-08] "Hold on a minute! I never saw this thing before in my life; I found it in Ketill's house when I came to take him back to Houton."
[6D-08] "The perplexing problem is, if I were to let you go, my feral friends here would consider me a coward. You see they might even get into their noggins the notion that they could takeover this bloodthirsty band. So we're going to bash your brains and purloin your property.  Nothin' personal, you understand."
[6E-08] "Quick, cut me loose, so I can fight!"
[6F-08] "Like hell! You'll bugger off as soon as I do!"
[70-08] "All right Ketill, but don't betray my trust!"
[71-08] "Are you daft, man!? Let me loose or they'll kill us both!"
[72-08] "As long as you go first at least I'll have some entertainment before I die."
[73-08] "All right, Ketill.  I'm trusting you!"
[74-08] "I was right! You are an idiot!  And sure as not they'll brain you with a club and you'll lose what little wits you've got remainin'."
[75-08] "Give my regards to the Sheriff, you simpleton!  Ha, ha, ha!"
[76-08] "I've got to go see a guy about a gelding.  So I'll suffer you to survive for now! When we assemble again you won't find yourself as fortunate."
[77-08] "Despite the Bard's warm and shining personality, people continued to run from him like the plague.  Perhaps he would one day learn that in order to keep friends near, a man such as himself  needed to keep them tied up."
[78-08] "If only I could find a sock big enough to put in that mouth of yours."
[79-08] "You can run, Ketill, but you can't hide."
[7A-08] "You'd never have found me if it weren't for that mangy dog!"
[7B-08] "Mangy?  Well, there's the pot calling the kettle black.  Or Ketill calling the pot black.  Or... forget it. Just start walking."
[7C-08] "I can't believe you found me!"
[7D-08] "Wasn't too hard.  I just followed the sound of your knees knocking together."
[7E-08] "Just let me go, won't you?  I'll give you everything I've got!"
[7F-08] "You've got nothing I want... At least nothing that I haven't already taken. Now move!"
[80-08] "Just you wait! My brother Shaw'll hear about this. Then you're going to get it! You'll see!  He doesn't like people picking on his kid brother.  No sir..."
[81-08] "Shut your gob... and stand downwind. You're making my dog sick."
[82-08] "Shut your gob... and stand downwind. You're making me sick."
[83-08] "And so with Ketill in tow... again... the Bard worked his way out of the woods."
[A5-0A] "You ugly pug!"
[A6-0A] "Come and get me!"
[A7-0A] "Hey!  That's a nice outfit you're wearin'!  Did your sister shave her back and knit you a sweater?"
[B5-0B] "Ketill's hideout"
[BC-0B] "I know you've got an entire alliteration thing going but exquisite and eagle is pushing it a bit don't you think?"
[BD-0B] "If there's one thing I hate it's Kunal Trow with delusions of grandeur."
[F5-0C] "Welcome, welcome to Chubnik's magical waterway transportation service to ...the future!"
[F6-0C] "Are you serious?"
[F7-0C] "Not the first time I've been asked that question.  Yes, you heard right, Chubniks' magical waterway transportation service will, for a modest fee, whisk you not just across the raging Chubnik river, but also transport you into...the future!"
[F8-0C] "How far into the future?"
[F9-0C] "That depends on how long it takes to cross the river."
[FA-0C] "Oh I get it. Nice scam, nice scam. So you are going to take me across that little stream for some ridiculous fee, when I could quite easily take your boat and cross myself, right?"
[FB-0C] "A wise man you are, that is for sure. But wrong you would also be. I of course have taken magical precautions against such an occurance. Any attempt by someone other than myself to use this boat and it will sink into the river. Not until it reaches the deepest portion of course. Only the tiniest fee is required to garner my services. 15 silver."
[FC-0C] "15 eh? I don't know, that sounds a little high, since you seem to love the river so much perhaps you'd care for a little swim?"
[FD-0C] "I see. It's obviously your first visit to Neversdale and as a first time visitor I may be able to give you a small discount. Now don't tell your friends. This is a special deal only for you. 10 silver."
[FE-0C] "Seems like a fair price.  I do get a bit squeamish aboard ships though."
[FF-0C] "Very good, sir. Trust me, you will not regret it."
[00-0D] "Now keep your arms and legs inside the vessel at all times.  You aren't pregnant are you?  No, of course you're not."
[01-0D] "The raging Chubnik river and the surrounding Chubnik Valley contain over 1000 types of flora and fauna. Let me point out a few."
[02-0D] "Be careful as you disembark and thank you for choosing Chubnik's magical waterway transportation service... We know that you have a choice in your waterway transportation services and we value your patronage."
[03-0D] "You and he could have a battle of wits and no one would score."
[04-0D] "That water looks very cold. And deep. Shall we find out?"
[05-0D] "Well sir, it is obvious we are at an impasse, so to speak. But considering your gentle manner, I will take you across, without charge, post haste. We here at Chubnik's magical waterway transportation service believe in treating our customers in the manner they deserve. Cheaparse."
[06-0D] "What was that?"
[07-0D] "I said... Let us pass... Across the river that is!"
[08-0D] "To all passengers, we regret to inform you that this voyage will be without snack and beverage service due to recent budget cuts."
[09-0D] "Thank you for choosing Chubnik's magical waterway transportation service."
[0A-0D] "That sounds more reasonable. I'm tired of listening to my own wet boots stomp through the forest anyway."
[0B-0D] "Belcome to Piskey's baggical matermay transpor... transpor... transport thingie... to the future!  Oooooooooo!"
[0C-0D] "Excuse me?"
[0D-0D] "I don't smell anything...Wait! You're the Barf! Right, my brother told me about you. What did he say? He said the Barf..."
[0E-0D] "Listen, I don't have time for your ramblings. Perhaps you could take me across the river?"
[0F-0D] "Taking the Barf across the river! That was it! Now what was the special Barf deal?"
[10-0D] "I tell you what, I'll make the same deal I did with your mate down the way.  I won't gut you and you'll cross the river with us alive."
[11-0D] "I remember! My brother said, \"Don't let the Barf cross unless he pays at least 100 silver!\""
[12-0D] "I guess he told you that because he wants to see you float down the river face first."
[13-0D] "I'd like to see you try. I took a potion... Makes me invul.. Invulerv... invernurable. Don't tell my brother though, cause sometimes, it makes me a bit drunk. Shhhhhhhh!"
[14-0D] "See! I make it myself.  Now you can pay to cross. Or you can stay here. And if you don't got 100 silver, well then you'll have to just shake it out of the trees."
[15-0D] "That doesn't look like 100 silver. Ok, let's count it...1...2...2...2... Ach close enough."
[16-0D] "I'll be back."
[17-0D] "Keep your arms in your legs.  Let's get this road on the ship."
[18-0D] "You know as the captain of this ship I can legally marry you two, if you want."
[19-0D] "Now befareful as you get out because the dock is made out of hickory wood and it can get slick if its wet. Which makes it a very slippery hickory dock."
[1A-0D] "Ready to board?"
[1B-0D] "Pay River Toll"
[1C-0D] "Pay River Toll"
[1D-0D] "Pay River Toll"
[1E-0D] "Aye Aye Captain."
[1F-0D] "Let's get going."
[20-0D] "Well the Chubnik river is a sight not to be missed. Come back and bring the whole family!"
[21-0D] "Oops.  It seems I misplaced some silver."
[22-0D] "Not just yet."
[23-0D] "Seeing as I'm in a bit of a hurry and you're not in much condition to sail.  Why don't I just take that ferry across on my own?"
[24-0D] "Can't do that.  Too danger dangerous the Piskey river is, for the novice."
[25-0D] "How much did my brother pay or charge you?"
[26-0D] "Give him a bit of a ribbing did you?"
[27-0D] "Good. He's too up right anyway. I'll take you over for the same price."
[28-0D] "Ready to shoot on across the Piskey river?"
[29-0D] "10 silver, I think."
[2A-0D] "Maybe."
[2B-0D] "But since you are such a nice person, I'll take you over for free. Just don't tell my brother. Shhhhhhhh!"
[2C-0D] "I think this is 100 silver."
[2D-0D] "If we are attacked by kunal trow bandits, its women and children first.  They love moving targets. Who doesn't?"
[2E-0D] "Hey Ketill what are you doing here! You know Fnarf is looking for you. Fnarf rhymes with Barf!  I can make up a song about you two."
[31-0D] "You have received a Buckler"
[BF-0E] "I know he left it here somewhere... Fnarf'll pay me handsomely to get it back... where is it?"
[C0-0E] "Well if it isn't my old friend Bannafeet."
[C1-0E] "What? Oh it's you."
[C2-0E] "Yes it 's me and I seem to recall when we parted ways I was owed a little magic."
[C3-0E] "Now, now Bard... let's not be hasty..."
[C4-0E] "Then I think I'll kill you slowly."
[C5-0E] "What makes ya think I'll stand still long enough to let ya do that?"
[C6-0E] "Ye'll never catch me."
[C7-0E] "Ye've actually used a sword before have ya not?"
[C8-0E] "Ha! Ya fight like a wee girl!"
[C9-0E] "Over here!"
[CA-0E] "Hahahaha"
[CB-0E] "Enough. You win Bard I'm getting tired of playing around with ya. Here's that tune I owe ya. Now, leave me be!"
[CC-0E] "You're free to go... just never mess with me again!"
[CD-0E] "Aye, it's sorry I am that I ever laid eyes on ye!"
[CE-0E] "I surrender! I didn't think ye had the brains to use a bow on me... here you go, the tune I owe you just don't shoot!"
[CF-0E] "What have we here? A wandering wastrel trolling around my territory? I'm Fnarf my friend and you are in terrible trouble."
[D0-0E] "Right...Fnarf  is it? Why don't you go on your way and I'll go on mine. I don't want any trouble."
[D1-0E] "Anything if you'll just shut your mouth."
[D2-0E] "Well now. What have we here? The boorish Bard and... Ketill. Ketill my clandestine companion when was the last time we saw each other?"
[D3-0E] "If it isn't the boorish Bard."
[D4-0E] "Listen Fnarf, why don't you go on your way and I'll go on mine. I don't want any trouble."
[D5-0E] "There he is! The one who killed Fnarf! Get him!"
[3F-12] "Ketill of course took the opportunity to run away."
[40-12] "Though Fnarf had escaped, the Bard had the unmistakeable feeling that they would meet again."
[41-12] "Of course, that's how these things always work If they just stayed around and took their beating like a man the first time, they'd save me a lot of trouble."
[A7-12] "Daft young fool. What was he on about? Some sort of princess he was going to rescue? Chosen one? He must have been out of his mind."
[A8-12] "The Bard of course was overcome with sympathy for the poor deceased young man."
[22-13] "Trow Song 1"
[BF-13] "Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  A chosen one of many isn't new.  When you think you're full of luck in the bullocks you'll get struck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  Now, Ogan came young from the farm and tried to save the princess from all harm.  Equipped with just a stick, and a head made out of brick, his rabbit's foot failed as a charm.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  The prophecy is never coming true.  In a pickle you'll be stuck, like a chicken you will cluck.  Oh, It's bad luck to be you.  Believing that he was the One, his ego weighed in at a ton.  His mum's a crazy bat.  Did we mention she was fat!  And she'll need a pine box for her son.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  Don't think for just a second it's not true.  When your life is run amuck you will see that you're the schmuck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be, really bad luck to be, nobody could disagree, it's a freakin' guarantee, it's bad luck to be you!  Diddly doo."
[19-15] "The Bard knew that Ketill hadn't enough time to go far, the villain must  be hiding someplace close at hand."
