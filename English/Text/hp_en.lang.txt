[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[84-08] "And the bard, already bowing to the wishes of his betrothed, made his way to the trow infested Highland Park."
[85-08] "Before you say anything, I'm not here to cause any trouble."
[86-08] "Cause no trouble and you'll have none from me. What is it you want here?"
[87-08] "All I need is a magical instrument from a Trow in this park and I'll be on my way. Are you him?"
[88-08] "I be not, but I know who be he. You'd do well to turn around now for he's not an accomodating sort."
[89-08] "I have to at least make an effort, perhaps we can make some sort of arrangement. Can you take me to him?"
[8A-08] "No need stranger, Fnarf will be here any moment."
[8B-08] "Fnarf?"
[8C-08] "Oh you've crossed paths before?"
[8D-08] "Yes, and it was quite a crossing."
[8E-08] "It's said Fnarf never forgets a face... Or a grudge."
[8F-08] "Well that won't do either of us any good."
[90-08] "Treat him with respect and he may not gut you on the spot."
[91-08] "Well that's comforting to hear."
[92-08] "If it isn't the very boorish blackguard I was hoping to see."
[93-08] "I was about to say the same thing, but with less...embellishment."
[94-08] "Master, this traveler has come for a magical instrument."
[95-08] "Is that correct? You're after my prized possession eh? Well you may have it... Over my cold cadaver!"
[96-08] "It's a shame you learn so slowly, I hate teaching a lesson twice."
[97-08] "You'll notice that you have a considerably larger class to teach. You were a fortuitous fellow to catch me off guard last time. This time I've come properly prepared."
[98-08] "You do appear more prepared, but I can still teach you a thing or two."
[99-08] "Let the educational experience begin."
[9A-08] "Oh, good you're here! Listen, I was sent to help you. I know you're after Fnarf, and I'd like to help you find him, but I'm afraid of those dirty little Trow.  If you protect me, I'll help you get past them."
[9B-08] "I seriously doubt that I need your help, these Trow are no match for me."
[9C-08] "No offense, but how exactly are you going to help me while hiding behind that tree?"
[9D-08] "I wasn't suggesting that I help you fight the Trow, I was only going to show you the way.  When you change your mind, I'll be right here behind this tree."
[9E-08] "I can help you get to where Fnarf is hiding.  I've spent a lot of time in this forest and I know my way around."
[9F-08] "I'll tell you what, you stay there guarding the tree and I'll come back for you if I need something."
[A0-08] "With the day I'm having, I need all the help I can get, come on, lets go."
[A1-08] "I told you that you'd need my help. Are you ready to admit it?"
[A2-08] "You have an awful sharp tongue for someone who's afraid of a Trow."
[A3-08] "I admit it. let's go."
[A4-08] "Ready to admit you need my help?"
[A5-08] "No, not really."
[A6-08] "No more lip out of you, let's go."
[A7-08] "Well?"
[A8-08] "Never mind."
[A9-08] "Let's go."
[AA-08] "Don't Hurt me! Don't Hurt me!"
[AB-08] "Ok, time for me to help..."
[AC-08] "Watch out, that's a..."
[AD-08] "...ow, that had to hurt."
[AE-08] "Actually, I kind of enjoyed it..."
[AF-08] "And they call me a deviant..."
[B0-08] "Ok, here we go again."
[B1-08] "I can hardly wait."
[B2-08] "Is it just me, or does it smell like bacon around here."
[B3-08] "Stand back, I'm going in."
[B4-08] "I just never get tired of watching that."
[B5-08] "Oh no, I should never have left him..."
[B6-08] "Left him, what do you mean?"
[B7-08] "I was sort of guiding him through the forest, but I sort of, you know, left him when the Trow attacked."
[B8-08] "I wonder what that must feel like. He wasn't, by any chance, after the same thing I am, was he?"
[B9-08] "As a matter of fact, he was. But he wasn't like you, he was special, He said he was the One, The Chosen..."
[BA-08] "Don't finish that sentence."
[BB-08] "But..."
[BC-08] "If you mention the Chosen one again I am going to be feeding pieces of you to the Trow.... Now, let's see if he has anything useful on him."
[BD-08] "And so our chosen one searched a former chosen one to see if there was anything of fine choosing on his person. Choose wisely chosen one."
[BE-08] "Ok, here we go again."
[BF-08] "Yeeeeee Haaawwww!"
[C0-08] "Is it my turn, or yours?"
[C1-08] "You really should try this."
[C2-08] "That still cracks me up."
[C3-08] "Shocking."
[C4-08] "We meet again my miniscule musical menace."
[C5-08] "Can we skip the alliteration and get right to the fighting?"
[C6-08] "As you wish my fiendishly fanciful foe."
[C7-08] "I'm really going to enjoy killing you..."
[C8-08] "Our begrudgingly brave but bedragled Bard set out to return to the pleasingly pert Princess Caleigh."
[C9-08] "I've had just about enough of these atrocious alliterative announcements... Now I'm doing it!"
[59-0B] "You have received Glaisne"
[D6-0E] "Aye that's his name, the wiliest Kunal Trow your likely to meet."
[D7-0E] "That's not saying much."
[D8-0E] "What is this boorish blackguard doing here?"
[D9-0E] "Is there no arrangement that we can reach?"
[DA-0E] "There will not be any arrangement or agreement other than you're inevitable evisceration."
[DB-0E] "Inevitable and evisceration? Right, you're a dead man... errr Trow."
[EA-0E] "Look out it's the Trow!"
[EB-0E] "They're gonna kill us all!"
[EC-0E] "Do something Bard! We're gonna die!"
[ED-0E] "There you are. I've been wondering where you ran off to."
[EE-0E] "You did it! You've made it farther than any of the other chosen..."
[EF-0E] "I've already warned you about that!"
[F0-0E] "You really are quite touchy you know that?"
[F1-0E] "I can't imagine why with such wonderful allies."
[F2-0E] "No cause to get nasty. Here I've got just the thing to cheer you up... a new tune, this is a good one too... why... err why are you looking at me like that?"
[F3-0E] "You've had that all along?"
[F4-0E] "Yes."
[F5-0E] "And I'm guessing it summons some sort of warrior?"
[F6-0E] "Well, yes."
[F7-0E] "Then why in the name of all that's holy didn't you give it to me when we first met!?!"
[F8-0E] "Errr... well I... that is... it seemed... You know that... don't hurt me! Here take it!"
[F9-0E] "The things I do for lust."
[FD-0E] "Are they gone? Whew! That was close."
[FE-0E] "Is it safe? Let's hurry before more of them show up."
[FF-0E] "You beat them all? Good job Bard."
[49-12] "I can't take this much longer, save me!"
[4A-12] "Aaaaaaaagh!"
[4B-12] "We're doomed!"
[4C-12] "Run for your lives!"
[D1-14] ""
[E0-14] "Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  A chosen one of many isn't new.  When you think you're full of luck in the bullocks you'll get struck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  This minion seems to like to run and hide.  I wouldn't be too sure he's on your side.  If he leaves at every chance, you should kick him in the pants.  His strong point doesn't seem to be a guide.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  The prophecy is never coming true.  In a pickle you'll be stuck, like a chicken you will cluck.  Oh, It's bad luck to be you.  Have you noticed that while traveling on this path the bodies you've encountered felt the wrath.  Kunal Trow are very scary, and a few a bit too hairy, and their arm pits stink so bad they need a bath. Pee-Yew!  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  Don't think for just a second it's not true.  When your life is run amuck you will see that you're the schmuck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be, really bad luck to be, nobody could disagree, it's a freakin' guarantee, it's bad luck to be you!  Diddly doo."
