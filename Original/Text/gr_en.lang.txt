[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[04-00] "You won't be disappointed when you rescue me."
[DD-06] "You continue on despite our efforts?"
[DE-06] "If you can call what you've done up to this point an effort."
[DF-06] "You think you can slay our brothers and not pay a price?"
[E0-06] "I think I pulled a groin muscle fighting one of your druids if that makes you feel any better."
[E1-06] "It's time to cause you a little more pain than that."
[E2-06] "I don't know about that... Have you ever pulled a groin muscle?"
[E3-06] "Haven't you learned by now that you can't hurt me?"
[E4-06] "Oh I think I can hurt you, my friend, nice dog you have there, allow me to introduce my pet."
[E5-06] "My god! Now you'll pay!"
[E6-06] "Today you'll do the paying."
[E7-06] "I'll miss you little friend. By god I'll avenge you, I swear it. This isn't over yet."
[E8-06] "Saddened by the loss of his faithful companion, the Bard somehow found a way to carry on. With a tear in his eye..."
[E9-06] "It's not a tear!"
[EA-06] "Yes it is."
[EB-06] "No it isn't. I got something stuck in my eye."
[EC-06] "Oh have it your way. So... with something in his eye the Bard left behind his stiff as a board pup, and continued his quest for the shadow axe."
[ED-06] "Look up Bard..."
[EE-06] "Nice doggie... I don't care much for dogs."
[EF-06] "Neither does he, good bye Bard."
[F0-06] "Though the grass of greenlands was beautiful, it was permeated with danger as the dreaded Red Caps patrolled the land."
[F1-06] "The Bard soon came upon the tracks of some dread beast. Even as he examined the tracks a fellow who clearly had a serious problem approached."
[F2-06] "Ach!  Laddie!  Hye yon bogle awa, an' its 'twa pund sterlin' 'll gi' ye!"
[F3-06] "Come again?"
[F4-06] "Well, maybe clearly was the wrong word."
[F5-06] "Iv tol ye!  Beno afeered, bu' claught yer dirk an' run yon rigwoodie bogle thro'!"
[F6-06] "Tell you what, spit the rocks outta your mouth, then we'll talk."
[F7-06] "The bogle!  The Nuckelavee!  Ach!  I wist ye ha' go' nae usquabae in yer blude!"
[F8-06] "Would it help if I just killed the Nuckelavee?"
[F9-06] "Twood o corse!  Na gae on, gae on, ya vauntie creeshie skellum!"
[FA-06] "I'll take that as a yes."
[FB-06] "Oh Ma. Huten skillum! Ye died it! Em ut ur disspal."
[FC-06] "You better be thanking me! I'm betting that you're the man I'm here to see, are you MacRath?"
[FD-06] "Aye, aam MacRath an' whit did ye need me fur?"
[FE-06] "Well I almost think Dugan is playing some kind of joke on me."
[FF-06] "Dugan? dugan sent ye? ye main be 'at bard 'at he was talkin' abit. Where be auld Dugan hidin hiself these days?"
[00-07] "Ah bloody hell, looks like I'm gonna have to drag you back to see Dugan, maybe he speaks... whatever it is you're speaking."
[01-07] "With MacRath in tow and the Nuckalevee nothing more than a memory the Bard headed back to Dounby hoping to decipher MacRaths ramblings and move one step closer to earning his reward."
[02-07] "The happenings at the local cemetery told the whole story, and it was not a pretty one.  The dead were rising more frequently, and the land was becoming more and more chaotic.  Hopefully MacRath could clear up some of the mystery."
[03-07] "Ah kent it was a bad sign when tha deid began tae rise frae their grae, especially mah mammy in law. it was toogh enaw killin' 'er tha first time."
[04-07] "I wish I knew what the hell you were saying."
[05-07] "I don't even know what he's saying."
[06-07] "Thes is tha entrance cheil. gang doon an' fin' tha shadaw axe."
[07-07] "What on earth are you gibbering on about this time?"
[08-07] "Ur ye corned beef?!? thes is tha place, heed oan doon!"
[09-07] "This relationship is out of order."
[0A-07] "So this is the place you and Dugan were talking about.And all I have to do is wander down there in the darkness with god knows what trying to kill me and hope I stumble onto the shadow axe? Great."
[0B-07] "Mental luck cheil! rid mah ham ay those undeid an' tha shadaw axe is yoors."
[0C-07] "Uh, sure.  And, uh.... I'd gi ye thir breeks o' mine fer ai blink o' yer tousie lik."
[0D-07] "Ach!  Ye creeshie poofter!"
[0E-07] "Aha! Right! I knew I'd find you. You know what I want don't you?"
[0F-07] "I have no idea!"
[10-07] "My apology!"
[11-07] "Fine fine! I'm sorry for bumping into you. Now go die in peace... quickly."
[12-07] "You can chase me through the depths of hell, but you won't get an apology from me."
[13-07] "See, that's all I wanted. Byebye."
[14-07] "Then prepare to see me in hell! I will return over and over until you finally apologize."
[19-07] "AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
[1A-07] "AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
[1B-07] "Oooh I love that! Works every time!"
[1C-07] "Don't think it's because you scared me, it's just that you're so damn ugly... I'm sure you got that even when you were alive."
[1D-07] "You have entered the room of awakening, and something wants to see you again!"
[1E-07] "Well I'm damn sure I don't want to see it."
[1F-07] "I'm far too curious to have you leave before I get to see what it is. You know what they say... curiosity killed the cat."
[20-07] "Great... Someone get me a cat then."
[21-07] "I'll only show you the way out of here if you perform the ritual and bring back whatever wants to see you!"
[22-07] "I don't think so."
[23-07] "Very well, you'll be trapped here and die and then you'll become a ghost and have to spend all of eternity with me!"
[24-07] "Suddenly I'm feeling like reconsidering my decision. What do you need me to do?"
[25-07] "Simply light the torches around the room and let's see what happens!!!!"
[26-07] "I'm sure whatever it is you want me to summon will want to kill everyone in this room, and since you're already dead..."
[27-07] "That's the spirit.... Ha. Get it... the spirit! Oh never mind.  Let's get this show started. Tell you what, after you perform the ceremony, if you're still alive... I'll teach you a little bit of magic."
[28-07] "1 down 4 to go!"
[29-07] "Ohh the Anticipation is killing me... Oh wait... I'm already dead."
[2A-07] "I'll be real disappointed if this isn't exciting."
[2B-07] "I just can't stand it! Hurry!"
[2C-07] "Okay, here it comes!"
[2D-07] "Here it comes!"
[2E-07] "There you are boy! I missed you buddy. And look at you now, a ghost dog."
[2F-07] "The Bard was overjoyed to be reunited with his best friend... Albeit his only friend."
[30-07] "A dog? A dog? I made a trip all the way from the netherworld and all I got was a stupid dog?"
[31-07] "Hey, that would look good on a tunic."
[32-07] "Maybe you lit the torches in the wrong order. Can we try again?"
[33-07] "A deal's a deal. Open the door for me and my dog."
[34-07] "Very well, but I'm so disappointed. Oh, here's that magic we talked about."
[35-07] "Now this is what I was hoping for! Maybe after this some sucker will conjure you up to leap through the gate."
[36-07] "That was worth the trip from the netherworld. Bravo! Good show! Can we do it again in a couple hours? I have some friends who would love to see this."
[37-07] "Sorry, one show daily. Besides, I've had to deal with that thing once before. So just open the door, give me my reward and we'll part ways."
[38-07] "A deal is a deal. Thanks for the entertainment."
[39-07] "Do you seek the Shadow Axe?"
[3A-07] "Yes. It has been promised to me."
[3B-07] "Then it is yours..."
[3C-07] "Wait. That easy? You mean there's no crazy spells from you, a fight to the death, forcing me to jump and dodge and run around like an idiot?"
[3D-07] "I've had enough of the violence...take it!"
[3E-07] "On Second thought! I actually like your idea better."
[3F-07] "I've gotta learn to keep my mouth shut."
[40-07] "Finally, the Bard learned something which had been all too obvious to most of us from the beginning."
[41-07] "With the shadow axe finally in hand, the Bard could gain entrance to the third tower where his Princess waited. Most women would be happy with flowers, but Princess Caleigh seemed a bit more high maintenance."
[42-07] "You think?"
[5F-0B] "You are so going to rue this day.  We know what you're up to."
[60-0B] "Mindle..."
[61-0B] "First the Forest Tower. Then through the mountain pass for the Mountain Tower and now..."
[62-0B] "Mindle..."
[63-0B] "Now you're going to try to get through Stromness to get to the Island Tower, well not on my watch!"
[64-0B] "Mindle, you idiot!"
[65-0B] "Thanks for the tip, Mindle. That should make finding my way to the final tower that much easier."
[66-0B] "You knew already.  Don't pretend you didn't...I mean... I mean that's not really how...seriously, you knew, right? At least I didn't say anything about..."

[C5-0B] "Oh no, not another one of these guys."
[C6-0B] "Trow must breed like rabbits."
[C7-0B] "How many of these do I have to kill?"
[C8-0B] "Not again."
[C9-0B] "...get ready for some... What... what's going on? Where is Hrafn?"
[CA-0B] "Hrafn my friend how've you been?"
[CB-0B] "Bard? What are you doing in Valhalla?"
[CC-0B] "I'm not in Valhalla, you're in some god forsaken pit in the middle of Greenlands. Maybe you could help me out while you're here."
[CD-0B] "What is Hrafn doing here, Hrafn was just about to... errr... never mind but Hrafn needs to go back!"
[CE-0B] "Sorry. I'm not in charge of sending people back..."
[CF-0B] "Hrafn we weren't finished!"
[D0-0B] "Sorry Bard... Hrafn has better things to do!"
[D1-0B] "I sort of wish I had better \"things\" to do as well... hello again."
[D2-0B] "Ugh! Not you again... Hrafn we are leaving. Now!"
[D3-0B] "Surprised to see me you scum?"
[D4-0B] "If it isn't Ketill... enjoying where I sent you?"
[D5-0B] "Why don't you join me there!"
[D6-0B] "Well I never thought I'd say this but it's nice to see you Bodb."
[D7-0B] "Bard!"
[D8-0B] "Bodb!"
[D9-0B] "Quickly my friend have you freed Caleigh?"
[DA-0B] "Still working on that one."
[DB-0B] "There's something I have to tell you... I found out in the afterlife...you are in..."
[DC-0B] "Sorry interference from the spirit world... it happens sometimes."
[DD-0B] "What are you talking about, interference? Bring him back! Play back the entire message!"
[DE-0B] "Nothing I can do... sorry I just work here."
[DF-0B] "Praise Fionnaoch! Another chance to dispatch you! This time you are a dead man!"
[E0-0B] "Gonna to have to disagree with you on that point. You might want to look in a mirror."
[E1-0B] "Die!"
[E2-0B] "Yes! I William Hatcher the Chosen One am here for the Shadow Axe!"
[E3-0B] "Then Die!"
[E4-0B] "Wait here for the Bard in case he manages to get this far. You need only delay him long enough for my brothers and I to prepare a... surprise for him at the Isle Tower."
[E5-0B] "But... sir... the Redcaps..."
[E6-0B] "Are you more afraid of them or me?"
[E7-0B] "Well!?!?!"

[AA-0C] "This epitaph read"
[AB-0C] "An epitaph. It read"
[AC-0C] "The epitaph on the grave marker read"
[AD-0C] "It was obvious that the Bard had a fascination with the dead.  This epitaph read"
[AE-0C] "An ominous marker presented itself to the Bard. It read; Here lies the Bard. May he rest in peace, no longer making life miserable for those around him."

You're a foolish one, someone who should be shunned.  You buggered up this land so much your work is never done.  And when we see ya comin' we'll turn our tails and run.  You are the lad we love to hate. You are a foolish one.  It's fun, to run, you're done.  You aren't brave, you aren't strong or even that imposin'.  You have no magic helmet, or kilt or lederhosen.  If danger were to rear its head your feet would sure be frozen.  A sorry wuss, but nevertheless the sod who has been chosen.  A frozen, lederhosen, imposin'.  Oooohhhh!!  You're a foolish one someone who should be shunned.  You buggered up this land so much your work is never done. And when we see ya comin' we'll turn our tails and run.
