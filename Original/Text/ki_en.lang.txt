[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[66-01] "What you staring at? Never seen a Firbolg before?"
[67-01] "Sorry"
[68-01] "Excuse me."
[EC-01] "Care to make a donation my son?"
[2E-03] "And so the Bard arrived in Kirkwall, a peaceful and quiet town. The place seemed oddly familiar, and he would soon learn why."
[2F-03] "Oh my Lord!  I don't believe it!  I truly don't believe it!!  Do my eyes deceive me?"
[30-03] "One can only hope."
[31-03] "So much for peaceful and quiet."
[32-03] "My eyes speak the truth. My love has indeed returned. Although you vowed to return to my arms, time had cast doubt upon my heart.  It's been so long since that magical night."
[33-03] "Yes, a night of bewilderment, much like this moment. I've returned for you, but I was so afraid when I saw you again, my eyes would not recognize you. And yet, here you are."
[34-03] "I'm truly sorry milady, but I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone else. Someone less handsome I'm sure. I get that all the time."
[35-03] "Yes, the woman you professed your love to. Oh my heart, when I awoke that morning to find you gone, I was sure something had happened to you."
[36-03] "Surely you jest. That moonlit night, in the barn, up in the loft, you said you loved me, you said it was the most passionate moment you had ever experienced."
[37-03] "Yes m'lady. I went out that morning to pick you the most beautiful flowers in the land, and was abducted by a band of rogue gypsies. Only thoughts of you gave me the strength to fight and find my way back here."
[38-03] "To be honest, I'm sure I just came to my senses. Look, I'm sorry, I can't go on with this lie. I don't remember you, which means one of two things. Either we've never met, or that night was just magical for one of us."
[39-03] "Wait, wait, it's coming back to me. You must forgive me, for I have battled many men, faced many perils to return to you. A lot of men, many blows to my head. Of course I remember you my love, and I'm so happy to be with you once again."
[3A-03] "Can you be more specific?  I get a lot of that too. Look,  I'm sorry. I don't remember you, which means one of two things. Either we've never met, or that night was just magical for one of us."
[3B-03] "Oh my love, we'll share a lifetime of memories. Father will be so pleased. You must come around to the farm to meet him. I'm certain he'll love you as much as I."
[3C-03] "More love than I deserve I'm sure. Alas, I must leave you now to seek gifts to present to you and your father. You'll soon know how much my heart yearns for you, I promise."
[3D-03] "Until we meet again my love."
[3E-03] "And therein lies the loophole."
[3F-03] "Why I've never been so insulted in all my life."
[40-03] "Think hard, I'm sure you have"
[41-03] "When my father finds out, you'll get what's coming to you.  You're nothing but a... a... a beast!"
[42-03] "That obviously didn't bother you before."
[43-03] "You'll pay!!  I swear to you, you will pay!"
[44-03] "I already have. I must get myself a chastity belt, to keep me out of such trouble on such desperate nights."
[45-03] "You'd do all the world a favor if you threw away the key."
[46-03] "Don't go near old Finn's farm. He always packs a crossbow and he's eager to use it."
[47-03] "I don't know about you but I'm not sure about these Firbolgs, I mean they aren't even human!"
[48-03] "That shopkeeper kicked me out of his store when I asked if I could buy something on credit."
[49-03] "I saw a strange hooded man outside of town the other day, he was poking around near that old tower."
[4A-03] "Poor Connor! He should count himself lucky she isn't interested in him."
[4B-03] "I have a cousin who's an explorer, last I heard he was looking for a tomb way up in the mountains. I hope he's alright I'm a little worried about him."
[4C-03] "Some little kid just hit me with a stick, said he was the chosen one and he was gonna slay me. Do I look like a monster to you?"
[4D-03] "Excuse me, do you know where I might find one Bodb?"
[4E-03] "Aye, I be one Bodb. And may I ask who you be?"
[4F-03] "I ask the questions around here. I've been sent to you from Houton by one of your brothers. Do you have some music for me?"
[50-03] "I 'm a weary traveller in need of a small favor. I've been sent here from Houton by one of your brothers. I was told you would have some music that might be of interest to me."
[51-03] "Well someone got up on the wrong side of the haystack this morning.  How do I know you to be a trustworthy soul?"
[52-03] "It will be my pleasure to assist you. But first, how do I know you speak the truth about coming from Houton?"
[53-03] "How about this?  Count to three, and if you're not dead, you can trust me."
[54-03] "I can only ask that you believe what I say is true."
[55-03] "A man of conviction, I can respect that. Listen my friend, my name is Bodb, but it is another Bodb you seek. I'll be glad to take you to him."
[56-03] "As if you had a choice."
[57-03] "The Bard and Bodb traveled together in search of another Bodb."
[58-03] "Ok, here's what you do. Go down this street and you'll find the real Bodb."
[59-03] "Your name isn't Bodb?"
[5A-03] "Of course it is, why would I lie about that?"
[5B-03] "But you said..."
[5C-03] "I'm Bodb, I'm just not the Bodb you want.  It's not like I've cornered the market on the name Bodb."
[5D-03] "I'm not too fond of your attitude."
[5E-03] "Good, that means I've done as intended.  Now just take yourself that way, and you'll find who you need.  Just ask for Bodb, and tell him Bodb sent ya."
[5F-03] "Excuse me, are you Bodb by any chance?"
[60-03] "And who's asking?"
[61-03] "Hello there Bodb."
[62-03] "Oh good day Bodb. How's Agnus?"
[63-03] "Good, good.  And your Agnus?"
[64-03] "She's great. And the twins?"
[65-03] "Can we get on with this please?"
[66-03] "And who is this?"
[67-03] "I'm the man who would gladly make one less Bodb around here if you don't tell me what I need to know."
[68-03] "Just a simple and confused traveler who's been sent here to ask your assistance."
[69-03] "Now my good man, no need for violence.  You'll find you cannot know enough Bodb's.  I assure you we're here to help."
[6A-03] "Oh but we're not here to confuse, I assure you.  Just tell me what you need."
[6B-03] "You can help a little more by yapping a little less. Just teach me this magic and I'll be on my merry way, and your nose will remain in the middle of your face."
[6C-03] "Thank goodness. Just teach me the magic you know, and I'll thank you and be on my way."
[6D-03] "I must confess I like my nose where it is.  That being said, had I known you wanted Magic Bodb we could have saved a lot of time."
[6E-03] "You mean there's ANOTHER Bodb?"
[6F-03] "Of course.  If only you could have been more specific.  Come along, I'll take you to him."
[70-03] "For your sake, the third time had better be the charm."
[71-03] "Oooohhhh... You want the MAGIC Bodb. Well why didn't you say so?"
[72-03] "You better be joking."
[73-03] "If only I were my friend. I wish I could help you, but you want the Bodb down the street.  Try to be more specific next time."
[74-03] "Maybe my blade can be more specific."
[75-03] "Now don't be angry with me because of your lack of communication skills.  Move along, Bodb is waiting. And tell him Bodb said hello."
[76-03] "With pleasure."
[77-03] "So in a moment of dejavu, the Bard walked off to meet Bodb.  So in a moment of dejavu, the Bard walked off to meet Bodb."
[78-03] "Very funny."
[79-03] "I'm almost afraid to ask this, but is your name Bodb?"
[7A-03] "That's the name I go by.  And what do you call yourself?"
[7B-03] "Your worst nightmare if you don't give me what I want."
[7C-03] "Call me frustrated. But I'm hoping you can end this vicious circle I'm caught up in."
[7D-03] "I can see that if you were in my dreams I'd wake up in a cold sweat. Whatever I can do to keep you out of them, just ask."
[7E-03] "You poor man. If only I had the slightest bit of sympathy for a frustrated weary stranger taking up my precious time. But I suppose I can give you one question."
[7F-03] "Unless you wish to be in a dream state permanently, you will give me the magical tune I came here for."
[80-03] "If it wouldn't be too much trouble, I was told you could teach me a magical tune."
[81-03] "If you put me in a permanent dream state, then how could I take you to the Bodb who can actually help you. The magic I do is basic. Illusions, card tricks, palm readings.  I'll take you to the Bodb who knows the magical tunes. Come along my friend."
[82-03] "Magical tunes?  I see, magical tunes.  Well my friend, the only magic I could show you would involve a deck of cards, which I lost in a poker game ironically enough.  If you want magical tunes, that would be my good friend Bodb. You'll find him right down the street.  Good day to you."
[83-03] "Fair enough, here's my question.  Would you prefer to die by cold steel or strangulation?"
[84-03] "Really?"
[85-03] "Is old age an option?  Otherwise, how could I take you to the Bodb who can actually help you. The magic I do is basic. Illusions, card tricks, palm readings. I'll take you to the Bodb who knows the magical tunes. Come along."
[86-03] "Of course. That was an excellent question.  You're much brighter than you appear. Bright enough that I'm sure you can seek out my friend Bodb down the street. He has a soft spot for simpletons such as yourself.  Make sure you tell him I said hello."
[87-03] "You Bodb?"
[88-03] "Yes."
[89-03] "Uhhh yeah, let me see if I can put this succinctly. Give me what I want or I'll kill you. Is that clear enough?"
[8A-03] "Please, please help me!"
[8B-03] "You got it."
[8C-03] "I'm sorry, the law around these parts forbids begging.  Maybe one of my other friends will give you a breadcrumb or two. Move along."
[8D-03] "These bodbs had quite the wicked tongues. The old adage of \"if you can't beat them, join them\" was a piece of wisdom that our hero would have done well to remember."
[8E-03] "Go this way."
[8F-03] "Go this way."
[90-03] "Go this way."
[91-03] "Go this way."
[92-03] "This is the way to go my friend."
[93-03] "This is the way to go my friend."
[94-03] "This is the way to go my friend."
[95-03] "This is the way to go my friend."
[96-03] "Over here."
[97-03] "Over here."
[98-03] "Over here."
[99-03] "Over here."
[9A-03] "This is the direction to go."
[9B-03] "This is the direction to go."
[9C-03] "This is the direction to go."
[9D-03] "This is the direction to go."
[9E-03] ""
[9F-03] "No, no, not that way."
[A0-03] "No, no, not that way."
[A1-03] "No, no, not that way."
[A2-03] "That's the wrong way."
[A3-03] "That's the wrong way."
[A4-03] "That's the wrong way."
[A5-03] "That's the wrong way."
[A6-03] "Weren't you watching?  Not that way."
[A7-03] "Weren't you watching?  Not that way."
[A8-03] "Weren't you watching?  Not that way."
[A9-03] "Weren't you watching?  Not that way."
[AA-03] "I'm not here pointing for my health you know."
[AB-03] "I'm not here pointing for my health you know."
[AC-03] "I'm not here pointing for my health you know."
[AD-03] "I'm not here pointing for my health you know."
[AE-03] "You might want to try opening your eyes."
[AF-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[B0-03] "You might want to try opening your eyes."
[B1-03] "You might want to try opening your eyes."
[B2-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[B3-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[B4-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[B5-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[B6-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[B7-03] "Is it something I said? Come back over here."
[B8-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[B9-03] "La la la la la la la la la laaa."
[BA-03] "Hey, like I have all day!"
[BB-03] "Hey, like I have all day!"
[BC-03] "Hey, like I have all day!"
[BD-03] "Hey, like I have all day!"
[BE-03] "I have better things to do with my life besides waiting around for the likes of you."
[BF-03] "I have better things to do with my life besides waiting around for the likes of you."
[C0-03] "I have better things to do with my life besides waiting around for the likes of you."
[C1-03] "I have better things to do with my life besides waiting around for the likes of you."
[C2-03] "Hey, let me tell you how fun it is waiting around for you twiddling my thumbs."
[C3-03] "Hey, let me tell you how fun it is waiting around for you twiddling my thumbs."
[C4-03] "Hey, let me tell you how fun it is waiting around for you twiddling my thumbs."
[C5-03] "Let me tell you how much fun it is waiting around for you twiddling my thumbs."
[C6-03] "Hey, as long as I'm waiting around for you wasting my time, can I launder your shirts or resole your shoes?"
[C7-03] "Hey, as long as I'm waiting around for you wasting my time, can I launder your shirts or resole your shoes?"
[C8-03] "Hey, as long as I'm waiting around for you wasting my time, can I launder your shirts or resole your shoes?"
[C9-03] "As long as I'm waiting around for you wasting my time, can I launder your shirts or resole your shoes?"
[CA-03] "I hope you brought me something for waiting around for you all this time."
[CB-03] "I hope you brought me something for waiting around for you all this time."
[CC-03] "I hope you brought me something for waiting around for you all this time."
[CD-03] "I hope you brought me something for waiting around for you all this time."
[CE-03] "How nice to see you again.  I've missed you."
[CF-03] "Aye, and you shall be missing a limb or two if this run around continues."
[D0-03] "Enough to help me?"
[D1-03] "As I am fond of all my appendages, then I guess I can help you get where you need to go."
[D2-03] "Of course not. Have a nice day."
[D3-03] "Are you enjoying our fair town?"
[D4-03] "No actually. I'd like to register a complaint, with my sword."
[D5-03] "I'm sure seeing enough of it.  Care to show me more?"
[D6-03] "Hmmm, I see. Well my friend, let me take you to the complaint department."
[D7-03] "I'm sorry, tours are only twice weekly.  Come back tomorrow."
[D8-03] "Oh you again. You must be fond of punishment."
[D9-03] "Actually, I'm more fond of dispensing it.  Should I start with you?"
[DA-03] "Not particularly. What I would be fond of is a straight answer."
[DB-03] "It's about time you stood up to me. Come on my friend, I'll take you where you need to go."
[DC-03] "As soon as I have one you'll be the first to know.  Move along."
[DD-03] "Still haven't figured things out I see. Are you always this slow?"
[DE-03] "That depends on how painful I want your death to be, and a slow death seems very appropriate at the moment."
[DF-03] "On days like this, yes. Maybe you will be kind enough to help speed things up."
[E0-03] "I see, torture or help seem to be my only two options.  Since I can handle humiliation better than pain, I'll help you."
[E1-03] "Of course. And maybe someday people will be able to fly. Good day, stranger."
[E2-03] "Do unto others as they do unto you seemed like an appropriate code for our hero to live by."
[E3-03] "Don't you know that nice guys finish last?"
[E4-03] "What about nice guys with big swords and short tempers?"
[E5-03] "Won't you please help me?"
[E6-03] "That's more like it!  I'll be happy to help you."
[E7-03] "Sorry but no."
[E8-03] "You again?  Let me spell it out for you, I'm not going to help another loser who can't stand up for himself."
[E9-03] "How about I beat you senseless just for my own amusement?"
[EA-03] "I was told you would help me."
[EB-03] "That's more like it! Let's go find Bodb."
[EC-03] "I'm not responsible for what you were told, you really are pathetic aren't you?"
[ED-03] "You're never going to figure out why we're giving you the run around are you? Persistance does count for something I suppose, let's go."
[EE-03] "We were trying to toughen you up, but clearly it's not working... let's go."
[EF-03] "Well why wasn't I invited to the party?"
[F0-03] "Well why wasn't I invited to the party?"
[F1-03] "Well why wasn't I invited to the party?"
[F2-03] "Well why wasn't I invited to the party?"
[F3-03] "Believe me, this is no party. I've no more patience with any of you."
[F4-03] "Well that's a shame, without the four of us, I'm afraid you can't be helped."
[F5-03] "Well that's a shame, without the four of us, I'm afraid you can't be helped."
[F6-03] "Well that's a shame, without the four of us, I'm afraid you can't be helped."
[F7-03] "Well that's a shame, without the four of us, I'm afraid you can't be helped."
[F8-03] "Like I always say, the more the merrier. What's one more Bodb gonna hurt. Come along."
[F9-03] "The Bard and the four Bodb's ventured forth. How quickly the rude are attracted to the rude."
[FA-03] "Though it had taken longer than expected, the Bard and the four Bodb's ventured forth. A prime example of the rude leading the rude."
[FB-03] "Though it had taken longer than expected, much much longer than expected. The Bard and the four Bodb's ventured forth. A prime example of the rude leading the rude."
[FC-03] "Once you're inside, work yourself through the maze until you find four barrels. Behind those barrels is a passage that will lead you atop the bluff.  There you'll meet a very good friend of ours who'll show you the way."
[FD-03] "Why do I have the feeling that this little run-around is far from over?"
[FE-03] "Believe us my friend, there is a method to our madness."
[FF-03] "I'm sure there is, but no reason to take me down with you."
[00-04] "After stumbling around in the dark, and with the help of his newfound companion, our hero found the secret passage to the top of the bluff."
[01-04] "I've been expecting you.  Allow me to introduce myself.  My name is..."
[02-04] "I must say your future will become very bleak if you say Bodb right now."
[03-04] "As you wish. Far be it for me to shorten my own future."
[04-04] "Just tell me, are you the one I seek?  And I emphasize the word the."
[05-04] "I am he whom you seek. For safety sake, you may call me... well... whatever you'd like actually."
[06-04] "Then I'll call you homely, for that's an apt description."
[07-04] "As you wish. I'll even dance if it keeps that sword out of my belly."
[08-04] "I've seen enough song and dance for one day.  So Homely, why have I been summoned to this armpit of a town."
[09-04] "You've not been summoned my friend, you have been chosen. Quite an honor I might add, for only the strongest and most courageous in all the land would have been chosen by the beautiful Princess Caleigh."
[0A-04] "Beautiful Princess? Let's hear more."
[0B-04] "Aye Princess Caleigh is the lovliest lass in all the land. It makes me weep to think of her plight."
[0C-04] "If you tell me that I've been chosen again, I'll run you through. Now, without using the \"C\" word, explain what the hell you're on about."
[0D-04] "Errmm... Yes, well... as I was saying, you were... asked to come here by the fair Princess Caleigh, the good lord bless her."
[0E-04] "Continue... not that I know where this is going."
[0F-04] "Our fair princess is being held captive atop an ancient tower. Dark forces keep her locked away in a mystical prison. Only she..."
[10-04] "Sigh. Why does this always happen to me? Oh go ahead and spit it out, for God's sake."
[11-04] "How did you know? That's astonishing!"
[12-04] "Let me guess... only she can defeat the evil? Always a tower isn't it? Nobody's ever held at ground level anymore."
[13-04] "I... that is... well, you pretty much covered it."
[14-04] "Yeah, yeah only she can defeat the evil. Please, oh please, could you risk your neck to save her? Blah, blah, blah...etcetera, etcetera. I've heard it all before. That all you've got?"
[15-04] "Wait! Did I mention that she's as rich as she is beautiful?"
[16-04] "Sorry friend, not interested, these princess rescues always turn sour. The last princess I tried to rescue... well let's just say the ogre was dying to give her back."
[17-04] "With visions of coin, cleavage, and carnage jiggling in his head, the Bard and his new found friend head off to be in the presence of the mysterious Princess Caleigh."
[18-04] "Here we are my friend."
[19-04] "I see no tower here. I thought you were taking me to see this princess."
[1A-04] "Aye, and you shall speak with her, just not in the flesh."
[1B-04] "But eventually I do see flesh, right?"
[1C-04] "In due time my impatient friend. In due time."
[1D-04] "You remember my brothers?"
[1E-04] "Yes, but I'm so bad with names."
[1F-04] "Bodb!"
[20-04] "Bodb!"
[21-04] "Bodb!"
[22-04] "Bodb!"
[23-04] "Now I remember. Can we get on with this? If I don't see this princess soon, believe me Bodbs will roll."
[24-04] "As you wish.  As I mentioned to you before, Princess Caleigh is in an impenetrable tower."
[25-04] "I don't remember you mentioning the word impenetrable."
[26-04] "I didn't? Well, that's because it's only impenetrable to the likes of us. A strapping fellow such as yourself should have no problem."
[27-04] "Nice try. Go on."
[28-04] "The only way we can communicate with our beloved princess is by summoning an image of her, we have this ritual that..."
[29-04] "Enough words, let's see some action, some action."
[2A-04] "Very well. Are we ready my friends?"
[2B-04] "If this were a stage, I'd boo you off."
[2C-04] "Now Bodb... The bell!"
[2D-04] "Bodb!  Now or we'll lose her!"
[2E-04] "RING IT!!  NOW!!"
[2F-04] "Ding?"
[30-04] "Was that her? She looked familiar."
[31-04] "Where's the bell?"
[32-04] "Was that princess Calico?"
[33-04] "Caleigh. Bodb, the bell?"
[34-04] "I don't exactly have it."
[35-04] "She's the one who appears when I use this pendant."
[36-04] "Who does exactly have it?"
[37-04] "Farmer Finn."
[38-04] "So she's the Princess... And she's rich you say?"
[39-04] "Gambling again?"
[3A-04] "I'm sorry, I'm weak when it comes to temptation."
[3B-04] "Join the club. Who needs the stinking bell. Can't I just go and rescue her?  I could leave right now. Do you have a fast horse?"
[3C-04] "I'm afraid a rescue is impossible without information which only the princess can provide."
[3D-04] "Well I can summon her right now, she comes when I use this pendant."
[3E-04] "Aye let me see that... hmmmm it is as I thought. Where did you get this?"
[3F-04] "From the guy that sent me to you."
[40-04] "This pendant contains a  portion of her magical essence, a little bit of her spirit if you will. It'll invoke her power but does not allow for communication."
[41-04] "All right, so point me in the direction of this Farmer.  If I can't buy it back, I can find a way to con it out of him."
[42-04] "I obviously can't trust Bodb to go get it. But you must hurry, time is an issue. Get that bell, and bring it back here as soon as you can."
[43-04] "Then I can go get the princess, right?  No more run around."
[44-04] "Aye, and she'll repay you many times over."
[45-04] "And in many ways I hope.  I'll be back before you know it."
[46-04] "Our smitten Bard was on his way to see the farmer, with luck at his side and images in his head of the princess doing things I dare not mention."
[47-04] "Get off my land you filthy vagrant! You're not welcome here!"
[48-04] "No need for the crossbow old man, I'm just passing through."
[49-04] "Did Conner send you?  If so you tell him that I'll get him his money and the wedding is still off. My daughter doesn't want anything to do with him. You go back and tell him that!"
[4A-04] "I don't know any Conner. Now, why don't you just put down the crossbow and we can talk like civilized people."
[4B-04] "Get off my land now you wretched dog!"
[4C-04] "Hey watch out old man you might hit me!"
[4D-04] "Get off my land!"
[4E-04] "Oh perfect, Farmer Trigger Happy.  Well, I'm sure he's had a chance to cool down."
[4F-04] "I thought I told you to get off my land you filthy vagrant!"
[50-04] "Don't burst a blood vessel old man, I was sent here to reclaim an important artifact."
[51-04] "Ther're no artifacts on this land you idiot, mostly just chickens.  Did Conner send you? If so you can tell him that I'll get him his money and the wedding is still off. My daughter doesn't want anything to do with him. You go back and tell him that!"
[52-04] "I don't know any Conner and you're a bitter old coot aren't you?"
[53-04] "You have until I count to ten.  1, 2, 3, 4...uh, 5,......6....7.....8..."
[54-04] "Damn, where was I?"
[55-04] "3"
[56-04] "Right, 3.   3.......4....uh, 5,......6...7....8..."
[57-04] "The Farmer fortunately for the bard and much to my consternation had a difficult time reaching 10."
[58-04] "No no, keep goin, I have all day. But don't strain yourself; I can't have you passing out from exhaustion before I get what I want out of you."
[59-04] "I don't mean to trespass, I was sent here by Bodb, don't ask which one, to reacquire a bell that he had lost to you gambling."
[5A-04] "That is quite disrespectful stranger... I like it!  I haven't heard any wit in these parts since...well must have been the fourth year of the second age... Old man McGilicutty's great nephew Kyle, was he that tried it. Don't think it worked out that well for him though if my memory serves me..."
[5B-04] "Which at your age I hardly doubt."
[5C-04] ".. ..still, it has been a long time."
[5D-04] "I'll try to be brief so you won't forget. I'm here for the Bell you won from Bodb."
[5E-04] "I'm trying to get my hands on the bell that Bodb, don't ask which one, lost to you gambling. Do you have it by any chance?"
[5F-04] "You really are a nasty fellow aren't you."
[60-04] "Nasty? I thought I was on my best behavior. I don't get nasty until after I get what I want."
[61-04] "I am sorry old man, I don't mean to be nasty, I just want to get my hands on the bell that Bodb lost to you gambling.  Do you have it?"
[62-04] "I like you son, you're just as ornery as I am. That is refreshing.  I'll tell you what, since you cheered me up I'll just give you the bell you're after.  What d'ya think about that?"
[63-04] "There must be a catch."
[64-04] "Not too trusting eh?  I really do mean it, you can just take the bell, just don't tell Conner I gave it to you.  I don't want word to get out that I'm being generous, especially when I owe so much money."
[65-04] "Conner?"
[66-04] "Yeah, he wiped me out so badly gambling...  I had to trade him my daughter's hand in marriage to get out of debt."
[67-04] "That bell you're after, it's not for sale, but maybe there's something you can do for me and I could offer you the bell as payment."
[68-04] "Sure old man. What do you need, some chickens milked?  Some Cows plucked?"
[69-04] "Not quite, come with me."
[6A-04] "These pesky crows are eating all my crops,  if you can rid me of 'em, you walk away with the bell."
[6B-04] "That's it, birds?  Killing a few birds will square things up. Too easy old man, where's the catch?"
[6C-04] "You want the bell, kill the birds.  I'm old, time is precious.  Do we have a deal or not?"
[6D-04] "It's difficult to associate you with the word precious, but yes, we do have a deal."
[6E-04] "Good luck.  Meet me by the house when you're done."
[6F-04] "Talk about wasting my talents. You summoned me for this?"
[70-04] "Now we're talking! A real fight!"
[71-04] "So if I kill the Farmer, it's not as much a sin as it is a mercy killing. He's gonna most likely die any minute now anyways."
[72-04] "Any problem with the crows?"
[73-04] "No, but a heads-up on the scarecrows would have been nice."
[74-04] "Troublesome lot, aren't they.  Not only do they attract crows, but every time I tried to get rid of them, they took out half my crop. Last time I buy a scarecrow from a Trow."
[75-04] "That was more work than I figured, but I guess a trade is better than being in debt."
[76-04] "You said it!  Conner wiped me out so badly playing cards... that I had to trade him my daughter's hand in marriage to get out of debt."
[77-04] "I knew you were a despicable old man  but your own daughter to get out of debt, that's a nice twist."
[78-04] "You've got that right, but she ruined it by falling for some loser, now the wedding is off.  I feel sorry for Conner."
[79-04] "I feel sorry for the loser, but back to things that I actually care about.  If you hand over the bell now, we can finally be done with one other."
[7A-04] "The bell is yours. A deal's a deal."
[7B-04] "Tell your daughter I'm sorry I can't attend the wedding."
[7C-04] "Wedding, did I hear someone say Wedding?"
[7D-04] "Shoot him where he stands. You have some nerve burrowing your way onto our land, you scum."
[7E-04] "I see you've met my daughter."
[7F-04] "Uh oh."
[80-04] "This is the swine's behind I told you about."
[81-04] "I see you have your fathers wit. No wonder you traded her."
[82-04] "Daddy, this snake took advantage of me, then took off the next morning. You promised me marriage, and you broke my heart!"
[83-04] "Listen, lass..."
[84-04] "I believe our business is done here."
[85-04] "Couldn't agree with you more old man. And as I always say, if you just hand over the bell I'll be on my way."
[86-04] "One... Two..."
[87-04] "Please don't count again."
[88-04] "As you wish."
[89-04] "You hit my instrument!"
[8A-04] "Not the one I was aiming for. Now be gone with you and don't come back until you've made my daughter happy!"
[8B-04] "Our hero had once again been bitten in the behind due to his disrespect for women. Would he ever learn?"
[8C-04] "Who asked you? I obviously have two options here. Marry her, or find some poor fool to take my place.  Hmmm, let's make that one option.  I'll have to have a heart to heart with this Conner fellow."
[8D-04] "You've returned to me my love. Daddy, this is the man I was telling you about. We're getting married."
[8E-04] "Well welcome to the family... Loser."
[8F-04] "Thanks... Dad."
[90-04] "Would you like seven children, or an even eight? I think eight is enough for me. We'll be so happy together. And just think, someday this will all be yours."
[91-04] "Kinda brings a tear to your eye. Well, Dad, how about that bell?"
[92-04] "You're a cut-through-the-manure kinda guy, I see."
[93-04] "That's me."
[94-04] "You and I we think alike."
[95-04] "Like two Peas in a pod."
[96-04] "That's why I insist I give you the bell... on my daughters' wedding day."
[97-04] "I earned that bell fair and square."
[98-04] "Well It's all in the family now my son. To be honest, I'm glad it's you and not that good-for-nothing Conner. He hasn't the wit god gave my horse."
[99-04] "A wise man knows when he's beat. Let me go into town and spread the joyous news of our upcoming nuptials."
[9A-04] "Think of me while you're away beloved."
[9B-04] "Believe me, you're embedded in my brain. I just can't get you out of there. Until next time my love... Dad."
[9C-04] "Oh I know you'll be back."
[9D-04] "I can't wait to hear those wedding bell.."
[9E-04] "The Bard found himself engaged to none other than the farmer's daughter. It seemed our little hero was growing up. Get me a tissue."
[9F-04] "Who asked you? I obviously have two options here. Marry her, or find some poor fool to take my place.  Hmmm, let's make that one option. I'll have to have a heart to heart with this Conner fellow."
[A0-04] "Who the hell are you, get out of here. Leave me alone to wallow in sorrow."
[A1-04] "Sorry, I didn't know this was the ladies room."
[A2-04] "Please, please leave me alone. Try not to step on my heart on your way out."
[A3-04] "Don't you have the decency to leave a man alone with his sorrow?  Get out of here!"
[A4-04] "Unless you have a rope with you, you do me no good by being here. Leave me be!"
[A5-04] "Why must you continue to torture an already tortured soul?"
[A6-04] ""
[A7-04] "Let me guess, you're Conner..."
[A8-04] "How did you know?  Oh who am I kidding?  All of Kirkwall knows what a fool I am. Lend me your sword."
[A9-04] "My friend, no woman is worth taking your life over."
[AA-04] "What do you know of such matters?"
[AB-04] "I'd be afraid to lend my weapon to an oaf like you, you might snap off the blade while you're trying to stab yourself."
[AC-04] "How can she be longing for me when she dumped me for some low-life scoundrel?"
[AD-04] "I know the look of lost love because I recently came upon a woman suffering from that very affliction. It was Old Finn's daughter and she was pining for you."
[AE-04] "Not 'till the wedding night..."
[AF-04] "Low-life? I heard he's quite the stallion actually, but that's beside the point. You need to learn the way a woman works my friend."
[B0-04] "What kind of guy do you think I am?  I could never hit a girl."
[B1-04] "That's an image I didn't need in my head. What I mean is, she only dumped you for this guy so you would fight for her."
[B2-04] "You think?"
[B3-04] "Let me try again... And a little slower. A woman wants a man to chase after her, prove his love to her, and not take no for an answer.  She already loves you. You just need to show her that no man will stand between you."
[B4-04] "You know, you're right!"
[B5-04] "One of us has to. Now get out there and fight for her. Show her that no  man will stand in your way, no matter how impressive he is."
[B6-04] "I don't know who you are but you have a big mouth."
[B7-04] "Now go Conner, go and tell her you love her. Offer to marry her and don't take no for an answer!"
[B8-04] "You! I'll get you for that!"
[B9-04] "That's not all I have... y'see I'm the one who stole your woman away from you!"
[BA-04] "I'll do for you this time!"
[BB-04] "Ready to clean my boots with your face again?"
[BC-04] "Whatever you say love."
[BD-04] "I've had enough! I yield!"
[BE-04] "Nobody lies about my lady and gets away with it Bard."
[BF-04] "The Bard, hoping that his ploy had worked returned to Farmer Finn to find out if he could finally reclaim the bell."
[C0-04] "A rat! Someone do something!"
[C1-04] "Have no fear lass, a simple rat is no match for me!"
[C2-04] "Thank you kindly sir. Here's a little reward from me and the tavern."
[C3-04] "I've made your daughter happy Grandpa, so hand over the bell."
[C4-04] "I don't know how you did it son. I owe you thanks for getting her out of my hair."
[C5-04] "What's left of it."
[C6-04] "I'll miss these pleasant chats of ours. The bell is yours for the taking. There's an old horse out in the pasture, the bell is around his neck. Good luck."
[C7-04] "You chase the old nag around the pasture and grab the bell, and I won't slaughter all your chickens. How's that?"
[C8-04] "Well, me chasing that nag will do neither of us any good.  I'll drop dead, and you still won't have the bell."
[C9-04] "As much as I'd like that, I do need the bell."
[CA-04] "That old horse is possibly the meanest, nastiest creature I've ever known present company included. I put that bell on him so that I could hear him coming and get away as far as possible. If you get the bell off that horse you be sure and thank Bodb for providing a poor old man such amusement."
[CB-04] "Which one?"
[CC-04] "There's more than one?"
[CD-04] "Never mind."
[CE-04] "I see you're just as good with animals as you are with people..."
[CF-04] "He started it and I have the hoof marks to prove it..."
[D0-04] "Need help burying your horse?"
[D1-04] "Shh...don't call it my horse, I've never seen this animal before!  If the town elders see that you spilled the blood of my horse here we'll be stoned. They used to use this site for executions and sacrifices, back when we still did that sort of thing. I'm not about to be here when they decide to start again!"
[D2-04] "Great, just what I need, a mob of angry villagers at my heels. You aren't going to just leave it here are you?"
[D3-04] "And so the Bard with bell in hand, and the smell of horse on his shoes, rushed back to the temple to meet his new lady."
[D4-04] "I'll come back after dark when nobody can see me... Now let's flee from this place."
[D5-04] "Have you retrieved the bell my friend?"
[D6-04] "I was hoping you were just joking about the bell. You Bodbs seem to get a kick out of playing me the fool."
[D7-04] "That is very true, but I'm afraid we do need that bell. Come back when you have it."
[D8-04] "No bell, no babe my friend."
[D9-04] "I see you've returned."
[DA-04] "I see you have quite the knack for stating the obvious."
[DB-04] "Did you bring us the bell?"
[DC-04] "It took quite a bit of doing, and left quite a mess, but here it is."
[DD-04] "That's a nice little horse bell you've got there, but where's the bell we need?"
[DE-04] "What are you talking about?"
[DF-04] "The bell we want is blue, and has a little cow on it."
[E0-04] "That's some information that would have been useful earlier."
[E1-04] "Forgive them my friend, they are quite mischievous by nature."
[E2-04] "Yes, charming.  I will miss them... when they're dead!"
[E3-04] "I'm sure a talk with the princess will soften your anger. We shall summon her now."
[E4-04] "It had better work this time."
[E5-04] "I was hoping you would come, my valiant rescuer."
[E6-04] "Let's not get ahead of ourselves. What is in this for me?"
[E7-04] "A straight-to-the-point kind of man. Impressive. What do you get for freeing me? Well, you'll get me, riches beyond your wildest dreams, my kingdom at your feet, and me."
[E8-04] "You said \"me\" twice."
[E9-04] "Anything worth having is worth repeating."
[EA-04] "Good point. So are you going to give me directions, or are we just going to stand here desiring each other?"
[EB-04] "Let's not get ahead of ourselves."
[EC-04] "Touché."
[ED-04] "There is something you will need to obtain before you can free me."
[EE-04] "This just keeps getting better and better. And what do I need, other than a mental examination?"
[EF-04] "In the forest around Highland Park, there is a Trow who possesses a magical lute which you will need in order to rescue me. They are a stubborn and evil bunch, but you should be able to outwit them. Once you have obtained the instrument, return here and I will give you further instructions."
[F0-04] "Like what? Go out and slay a few dragons and capture moonbeams in a jar?  How about this?  Let's call this whole thing off.  If I wanted a run-around with a Trow, I would have married the farmer's daughter."
[F1-04] "There's no bluffing me Bard. I have the power to see into your mind.  I want you to take those images in your head right now, think of having them thrice daily, and then rethink if you'd like to help me."
[F2-04] "Well?"
[F3-04] "So where is this park exactly?"
[F4-04] "My devoted servants will show you. Good luck my friend, and return here once you have the lute."
[F5-04] "So what was that image in your head?"
[F6-04] "None of your business."
[F7-04] "Wait... let me guess. You don't have a key to this gate and I have to defeat some wizard on a mountaintop somewhere to get it. Right?"
[F8-04] "My goodness, where do you get such ideas?  I have the key right here."
[F9-04] "A first time for everything. Of course now I have to spoil this moment by asking why are these gates locked in the first place?"
[FA-04] "This used to be a wonderful park where the town would gather to play games and share food.  It was overrun by Kunal Trow, so we keep it locked for the town's safety."
[FB-04] "Leave it to a Kunal Trow to spoil a picnic."
[FC-04] "If you were another of those chosen ones looks like the only thing you'd have been chosen for is lunch. I'm guessing you don't mind if I borrow this armor, though it doesn't seem to do much good against wolves."
[FD-04] "Welcome back. Have you obtained the magical lute?"
[FE-04] "Not exactly."
[FF-04] "Come back when the answer is yes."
[00-05] "I was beginning to wonder if you survived the Trow."
[01-05] "What you should be wondering is if they survived me."
[02-05] "You've got the lute?"
[03-05] "And now, if you don't mind, I'm ready to collect my prize."
[04-05] "Very well. Let us call the princess."
[05-05] "You guys should really take this show on the road."
[06-05] "She learns fast."
[07-05] "If there was any doubt in my heart that you were the man to fulfill my dreams, it's now vanished."
[08-05] "You fulfill my pockets, and then we'll talk about your dreams."
[09-05] "As you wish, my great warrior."
[0A-05] "Told you she learns fast."
[0B-05] "Soon we shall be together, and I'll show you my gratitude. You must first go to the ancient tower east of Kirkwall."
[0C-05] "No, no, no, I've fallen for this one before.  A tower, or THE tower?"
[0D-05] "My captors are very clever, and there are three towers that seal my fate.  Why do you think I had to seek out a man of your intelligence and strength?  We will be together soon, I promise you that."
[0E-05] "Very well."
[0F-05] "Go to the entrance of the tower. To get inside, you must play a tune on that lute I had you acquire, any tune will do to open the door. From there, you may encounter some resistance."
[10-05] "I'm sure more than some."
[11-05] "When you reach the top, you must defeat the tower's guardian. The guardians power the flames that light each tower with their life essence. Once defeated the power of the guardian will be broken. With the guardian vanquished I will be able to visit you atop the tower with further instructions."
[12-05] "I better get something out of this soon, because your credit is already over extended."
[13-05] "Believe me, once I'm doing what I'm longing to do, you'll be more than satisifed."
[14-05] "I very much doubt that."
[15-05] "If only you knew how willing I am to prove you wrong. Good-bye for now my love."
[16-05] "I'm sorry, you have obviously wandered into what you believed to be the local tavern. That is down the street."
[17-05] "If you are looking for items to purchase my friend, merchandise for the less fortunate are available from a peddler at the end of town."
[18-05] "Oh hello. The merchant handing out charity for the poor is the next door down."
[19-05] "Oh yes, a dirk. How quaint. Not much protection, but it will fit within your means I suppose. I could let you have it for a pittance, well a maybe not a pittance to you."
[1A-05] "I suppose we need to sell these to someone. This won't do you much good, but one can afford what one can afford."
[1B-05] "Ah, that would be a flail, my economically challenged friend. Simple, non-elegant, and packs quite the wallop. It might be on the steep end for you, but maybe you can borrow the money from friends. Not that you have any friends of course."
[1C-05] "Nice purchase. Good to see you making an effort to get off of the bottom rung of society. Just try not to hit yourself in the head with it."
[1D-05] "I see you've found the claymore. Beautiful isn't it. I suppose it's Ok for you to admire... from a distance. A very powerful two-handed sword, elegantly decorated. It hardly fits your attire, and your purse even less I'm sure."
[1E-05] "I'm impressed. Who would have imagined you could afford something that didn't come off of the bargain rack."
[1F-05] "Oh the standard longbow is a very appropriate choice for someone of your means. I'm afraid its quality is a lot like your financial situation... a little lacking."
[20-05] "Very practical choice. Yes, if I lived in poverty this would be my choice as well.  I'm just speculating of course."
[21-05] "Very nice, very accurate, very powerful, and most likely very unobtainable for a man in your position.  It costs nothing to dream however, but it will cost you some silver to actually purchase."
[22-05] "It must have been very difficult to give up your life savings, but if this saves your life, I suppose it's worth it... on the other hand I may be overvaluing your life, that is a very nice bow."
[23-05] "Made of wood from the oldest tree in the forests right here in Kirkwall this extraordinary bow can penetrate most armor quite easily.  Not that there's any reason to waste my breath, I'm sure you can't afford it. And I should mention the price of thievery in this town is your life."
[24-05] "Please accept my humblest apologies. I have heard of this, royalty disguising themselves as poverty-ridden scoundrels to study their subjects more closely."
[25-05] "This armor would be appropriate for you. It's a little behind the times, isn't of the highest quality, and well it's a little on the ugly side. Yes, a perfect match."
[26-05] "Good choice. Now why don't you just go and lay in a gutter or whatever you were doing before you came in."
[27-05] "This Studded Leather Armor might even make you look good. It will cost more than you can afford of course but if you wore this, people might actually take you seriously."
[28-05] "That part about taking you more seriously was just a little fib on my part, I still think you're scum."
[29-05] "This Chain Mail is the best armor money can buy, and more than your money can buy I'm afraid. More than you need anyway, unless of course you're on some sort of quest to save the world. But seriously, this would cost you a lot more than you have. I'd be quite shocked if you could even count that high."
[2A-05] "Whoever you robbed to get this money is certain to be awfully angry. Good luck."
[2B-05] "Oh, I didn't even know I had any of those left.  A quaint little wooden shield.  I've been using them for firewood, and even for that they don't serve much use."
[2C-05] "I admire a man who realizes the value of his own life. I'm actually kind of sorry to see it go with the nights getting colder."
[2D-05] "This Targ Shield may be a little pricey for you, we do have cheaper models."
[2E-05] "Good to see you value your life more than most people would."
[2F-05] "This Instrument is very used, a little dinged up, and really not very good too look at. You may actually be able to afford it. We don't normally carry items like this so I will be happy to get rid of it... And hopefully you as well."
[30-05] "Excellent. It looks much better on you than it does in my shop. Now get out."
[31-05] "Welcome to Kirkwall. Care to buy me a drink... I mean make a donation?"
[33-05] "Life had changed quite dramatically in the town since his last visit. It was as if the gates of hell had been opened, leaving The Bard to find the man who might hold the key to shutting them once again."
[34-05] "Bodb, what the hell happened here?"
[35-05] "Some idiot spilled the blood of an animal in the ring of the Nuckelavee. With the ring desecrated the Nuckelavee has risen to spread death and destruction."
[36-05] "Idiot might be a bit strong."
[37-05] "Not strong enough if you ask me."
[38-05] "We'll agree to disagree on that one."
[39-05] "I don't think you understand! The Nuckelavee is the harbinger of doom, that lackwit has doomed us all.  We must leave town immediately if we hope to survive."
[3A-05] "Exactly what I was thinking. Caleigh said something about a Mountain Pass leading to the Tower?"
[3B-05] "Oh, the Pass. We'll never make it through this time of year... Too cold. We might try going through the old Viking Tombs under the mountains, we'll need something from the tombs in any case."
[3C-05] "Viking Tombs?  I don't mean to sound negative, but that does sound rather unpleasant."
[3D-05] "No, trust me...what could go wrong?"
[3E-05] "Bodb?  Don't die until you tell me the location of the Tomb, err... I mean 'till I can get you help."
[3F-05] "The Mountain Pass is...is...blaaah."
[40-05] "I knew it. Perfect, the little twerp goes and dies on me."
[41-05] "Not a nice thing to say to someone on their deathbed."
[42-05] "Sorry."
[43-05] "Now be respectful, I'm trying to help you.  I only have so much life left in me to get out so many words, so I don't think I'm asking too much.  Don't you agree? I'm sure most people would. Glad you understand. Now, the mountain pass is.... Blaaaah."
[44-05] "Ok, that was a little dramatic."
[45-05] "Wait, I'm not done yet. Come closer."
[46-05] "Got it."
[47-05] "What had passed between poor deceased Bodb and the bard was anyone's guess."
[48-05] "He asked me to get my knee off his chest."
[49-05] "Ah."
[4A-05] "Then he told me the location of the mountain pass. I'm on my way."
[4B-05] "So are you dead?"
[4C-05] "Almost."
[4D-05] "Ok, good luck with that."
[4E-05] "The Bard headed to the mountain pass, leaving Bodb to die a slow, painful death."
[4F-05] "Who's gonna notice one less Bodb?"
[36-06] "Ah, the ale.  An effervescent start, with oaky overtones and a crisp finish with a peppery aftertaste.  Goes down smooth an' burns like hell on the way back up."
[37-06] "Bugbear's brew?  We just got it today.  It comes from Houton.  The Brewer's a randy old bugger; used to work here but I had to get rid of him, he kept feeling up the barmaids behind my back."
[A3-0A] "Finstown has been revealed on the World Map."
[CA-0A] "Look who it is Sean, it's the Bard!"
[CB-0A] "You're the hero of Finstown Bard!"
[CC-0A] "Certainly! You remember Finstown right? Why there's a big reward just waiting for you."
[CD-0A] "Please pardon my brother he often lacks manners. Just head over to Finstown and they are bound to give you your reward. The good people have been dying to see you again."
[CE-0A] "Very good. We'll... notify them that you're on your way. Let's be on our way brother..."
[CF-0A] "The Bard? I don't know any... ohhh the Bard."
[D0-0A] "Do you know us? You don't remember Finstown?"
[D1-0A] "Never been there? Why you..."
[D2-0A] "He is?"
[D3-0A] "You do?"
[D4-0A] "Do I know you two?"
[D5-0A] "Finstown you say? Can't say that I've ever been there."
[D6-0A] "I am?"
[D7-0A] "Oh you mean Finstown! Of course, of course... sorry I get that Hero bit a lot you know."
[D8-0A] "Of course, I'll head over there when I'm able."
[DE-0A] "Magic Bell"
[B9-0C] "Bloody idiot bard... Make me come out here... Middle of the night... Bloody rain..."
[BA-0C] "Yeah, I think you've wasted enough of both of our time. Why don't you go and recruit some idealistic young orphan to do it? They're pretty gullible."
[BB-0C] "Rich? How rich are we talking?"
[BC-0C] "The barest portion of her wealth could buy Dounby a hundred times over."
[BD-0C] "Not bad. And you said she's beautiful as well?"
[BE-0C] "The fairest in all the land."
[BF-0C] "You tempt me... but still..."
[C0-0C] "Prove it."
[C1-0C] "Let me do something to allay any doubts you might have. You can speak with the Princess directly."
[C2-0C] "How is that possible? If she's locked in a tower..."
[C3-0C] "I have my ways, just give her a chance to speak with you herself. She can be very... persuasive."
[C4-0C] "I expect to be well compensated for my time."
[C5-0C] "You will be my friend... you will be."
[C6-0C] "Errr... Ummm... prove it?"
[C7-0C] "Yes, prove it. If she's rich, then hand over some coin on her behalf. And if she's so bloody beautiful, then show her to me. If you can do neither of these things, then I'll be on my way."
[C8-0C] "Wait! I can show you the princess... give you a chance to see her. As for payment... is this sufficient?"
[C9-0C] "That should do... for now. I warn you though, if you are playing me false, I'll take it out of your hide."
[CA-0C] "No need for that... follow me. The Princess will convince you. I'm sure of it."
[CB-0C] "You beat him senseless! That was wonderful Conner! I never realized how... manly you were. Let's forget this loser and go someplace quiet!"
[CC-0C] "I hope nobody important saw that."
[CD-0C] "There he is Conner! There's the man who insulted my honor!"
[CE-0C] "I think you meant to say lies with... which is funny because I heard..."
[CF-0C] "Enough out of you!"
[D0-0C] "Ready to clean my boots with your face again?"
[D1-0C] "I'll do for you this time!"
[DA-0C] "Everything is currently out of stock, please leave."
[DB-0C] "Come back when you have money!"
[DC-0C] "As I thought!"
[DD-0C] "If you need money why don't you go waylay some kunal trow and steal their pants! That seems like your style."
[DE-0C] "We sell only the finest melee weapons here, much to expensive for you."
[DF-0C] "Bows? You couldn't even afford the string."
[E0-0C] "You want armor? You do realize that we don't sell on credit here?"
[E1-0C] "There's a shop in Houton that you might be able to afford."
[F2-0C] "Blessings upon you."
[F3-0C] "You've been good with your donations. I've a gift for you."
[F4-0C] "Welcome back. Care to make a donation?"
[2F-0D] "The Forest tower has been revealed on the World Map."
[30-0D] "The Mountain Pass has been revealed on the World Map."
[34-0D] "Temple"
[3D-0D] "She's not my lady."
[42-0E] "Meanwhile back in Kirkwall one of the Bard's past errors would come back to haunt him."
[80-0E] "So what'll it be?"
[81-0E] "What'll you be havin' today?"
[82-0E] "Ah this is one helluva stout. A strong rich malty flavor with a hint of hops. Goes down nice and creamy and leaves ya a bit o' foam in the mug to remember it by."
[83-0E] "Is it a beer? A whiskey? A wine? To tell you the truth I'm not sure. But I can tell you that if your feeling a bit o' luck you can't go wrong with this one."
[87-0E] "Come again."
[88-0E] "We'll see you next time."
[DC-0E] "Before I head into mortal danger, I just have to ask... what's with all of the missing limbs?"
[DD-0E] "Oh well at one time or another we've all tried to rescue the princess, this is about as far as we've gotten. I'm sure you'll fare much better, we sent one of our brothers in a few days ago, keep an eye out for him and he'll be sure to help you... If he's still alive that is."
[DE-0E] "That's so reassuring."
[DF-0E] "Good luck!"
[E0-0E] "I'm looking for a man named Bodb. Have you seen him?"
[E1-0E] "Hahahahaha."
[E2-0E] "Bodb? You're looking for Bodb? Look everyone it's another Chosen One!"
[E3-0E] "Oh I've seen \"him\" alright."
[E4-0E] "You poor poor man."
[E5-0E] "Oh you'll find one around here somewhere. Just keep looking."
[E6-0E] "I truly pity you. Good luck."
[E7-0E] "Hahahahaha."
[4D-12] "Go away!"
[4E-12] "Off with you!"
[4F-12] "You think you can hit me laddie?"
[50-12] "Hahahahaha!"
[51-12] "You couldn't hit the broadside of a broch!"
[52-12] "Too fast for you?"
[53-12] "The old Farmer was surprisingly spry for someone of his advanced years. Or was it just that the Bard was a horrible shot?"
[5B-13] "I thought we told them not to send any more weaklings... Oh alright follow me."
[5C-13] "We're supposed to make certain you're up for the challenge... But I give up! Follow me."
[6E-14] "It never seemed to occur to the Bard that knocking the piss out of  Conner would fail to solve his current problem."
[6F-14] "I suggest a new strategy. Let Conner win."
[75-14] "The Bard needed to find a way to make the Farmers' Daughter happy and forget about him at the same time. Perhaps seeking out her former betrothed would be of help."

[DF-14] "Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  A chosen one of many isn't new.  When you think you're full of luck in the bullocks you'll get struck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  The wolves over yonder packed a punch. So listen carefully to our hunch.  To be the Chosen One, really sounds like loads of fun, but in the end you'll just be someone's lunch.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  The prophecy is never coming true.  In a pickle you'll be stuck, like a chicken you will cluck.  Oh, It's bad luck to be you.  Your mourning for this boy was very brief. You certainly did not show any grief.  You pillaged his cadaver, but to you it didn't matter!  You're nothing but a two-bit common thief.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  Don't think for just a second it's not true.  When your life is run amuck you will see that you're the schmuck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be, really bad luck to be, nobody could disagree, it's a freakin' guarantee, it's bad luck to be you!  Diddly doo."

[93-15] "The Bard had come to Kirkwall in search of the man named Bodb. Just reminding him in case he had forgotten, which of course would never happen."
[94-15] "Somewhere near Finn's Farm the Bard had to find the Horse which carried the Bell he very much needed to lay hands on."
[95-15] "Word around Kirkwall was that Conner could frequently be found in the local bar. No doubt being betrothed to Finn's Daughter would drive any man to drink."
