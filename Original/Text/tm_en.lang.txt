[52-09] "So it was the Bard obtained everything his heart had ever desired... at the expense of the rest of the world of course. Thus concludes the Bard's Tale. Finally the end... I thought I'd never be rid of him... never ask me to read this halfwit's story again."
[68-09] "Who says the undead don't know how to party?"
[69-09] "So... Do you die here often?"
[6A-09] "So the Bard decided to take the short and narrow road, otherwise known as the easy way out, to the nearest bar. With the plight of the world obviously far from his mind, which by all accounts, only has room for coin and cleavage, the Bard enjoyed his drinks with his newfound friends, that is until... well that is another story."
[FB-09] "Beer beer beer tiddly beer beer beer.  A long time ago, way back in history, when all there was to drink was nothing but cups of tea, along came a man by the name of Charlie Mops, and he invented a wonderful drink and he made it out of hops.  Hey!  He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, and to his praises we shall always sing.  Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer tiddly beer beer beer.  The Drunken Rat, the Aiken Drum, the Trowies Pub as well, one thing you can be sure of, it's Charlie's beer they sell.  So all ye lads and lasses at eleven O'clock ye stop.  For five short seconds, remember Charlie Mops.  One, two, three, four, five, ...  Hey!  He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, and to his praises we shall always sing.  Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer tiddly beer beer beer.  A barrel of malt, a bushel of hops, you stir it around with a stick, the kind of lubrication to make your engines tick.  Forty pints of wallop a day will keep away the quacks.  It's only eight pence hapenny and one and six in tax.  One, two, three, four, five, ...  Hey!  He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, and to his praises we shall always sing.  Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer!  Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer tiddly beer beer beer tiddly beer beer beer.  The Lord bless Charlie Mops!"

[BD-13] "You are a jerk, a piece of work this mission you'll be blowin'.  There's one thing 'bout this castle here you surely should be knowin'.  That once inside your magic's gone and danger will be growin'.  And if you meet the Shadow Axe your blood it will be flowing.  You're knowin', it's growin', you're blowin'.  Oooohhhh!!  You're a foolish one, someone who should be shunned.  You buggered up this land so much your work is never done.  And when we see ya comin' we'll turn our tails and run.  You are the lad we love to hate. You are a foolish one.  It's fun, to run, you're done.  You aren't brave, you aren't strong or even that imposin'.  You have no magic helmet, or kilt or lederhosen.

[BE-13] "Come gather 'round all ye bastards, and raise up a cup to this arse-turd.  He came and freed the fires of hell, and let 'im run loose over hill and dell.  Here's to the Bard and his scab of a brain. Here's to the Dragon and all it has slain. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame, and it's ours for the taking, and you get the fame. We tortured some townsfolk, it's true, and pounded, but couldn't break through. With all his might the dragon took flight and burned the town down to a ball-bag of shite.  Here's to the Bard and his knob of a head.  Here's to the Orkney, the smoke, and the dead.  The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame, and it's ours for the taking, and you get the fame.  Here's to the Bard and a pullin' me plum.  Here's to the Beast and the rest of you scum.  The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame, and it's ours for the taking, though you get the fame."
[BF-13] "Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  A chosen one of many isn't new.  When you think you're full of luck in the bullocks you'll get struck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  Now, Ogan came young from the farm and tried to save the princess from all harm.  Equipped with just a stick, and a head made out of brick, his rabbit's foot failed as a charm.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  The prophecy is never coming true.  In a pickle you'll be stuck, like a chicken you will cluck.  Oh, It's bad luck to be you.  Believing that he was the One, his ego weighed in at a ton.  His mum's a crazy bat.  Did we mention she was fat!  And she'll need a pine box for her son.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  Don't think for just a second it's not true.  When your life is run amuck you will see that you're the schmuck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be, really bad luck to be, nobody could disagree, it's a freakin' guarantee, it's bad luck to be you!  Diddly doo."
[C0-13] "I'll tattle a tale that is terribly true,  started out as a rumor but suddenly grew.  And it deals with a man and a horse and a ring.  So settle on in and our song we shall sing.  It happened one day in a ring by a farm, something that tragically brought us much harm.  How could a place abundant with charm create such a beast with a spear for an arm?  On death and destruction is what you will get when he's coming for you in your kilt you will wet,  and he's big and he's strong and its quite plain to see that this is the tale of the Nuckelavee. Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee your big and evil and heinous.  Who could it be who set you free?  He really must be an anus. Oh Nuckelavee its easy to see the terror you leave is raining on me.  The village is burned and the taverns are missed and the beer is all gone and the elders are pissed.  And if they ever should find the fool we'll hang him upside down by his tool,  and spin him around until he gets sick, Ooh!  Aah!  Oh that should do the trick, HEY! Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee the terror you offer is high class. Who could he be who set you free? He really must be a dumb ass.  Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee the horror you furnish is widespread. Who could it be who set you free? He really must be an ox head. Now everyone knows no blood should spill in the sacred ring by the farm on the hill and if this ever happens then death you should fear. He'll kick in your nuts and he'll serve them with beer. So one final thought before I depart and this my friend comes straight from the heart.  We'd all be fine if not for that bell and that horse killing wanker who opened up hell.  Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee we cannot win we must admit. Who could it be who set you free?  He really must be a dim-wit.  Nuckelavee, Oh Nuckelavee are big and evil and heinous.  Who could it be who set you free?  He really must be an anus."

[8C-14] "The destruction of the Tower had caused a great tremor, leaving the mountains all but impassable."
