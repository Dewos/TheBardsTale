[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[ED-01] "Could you be any more melodramatic? It's bloody cold enough here without you making it worse."
[EE-01] "I don't know if you noticed, but it's a bit chilly here at the pass."
[EF-01] "Tell that to my arse."
[F0-01] "That's really... helpful. Why don't you stand in the back and not say anything, ok?"
[F1-01] "This must be the entrance to those tombs that dear deceased Bodb mentioned. Hmm... Talk about a chilly reception.  I won't be getting through there any time soon."
[F2-01] "Stop, stop, hold on. You don't appear to be freezing your arse off in this cold. What's your secret?"
[F3-01] "Well, as long as we're on the subject of your arse, let's talk about how I'll kick it up and down that mountain if you don't give me a chug of that."
[F4-01] "Well my warm-arsed friend, let us share a drink and a new friendship."
[F5-01] "I see you're a man who thinks ahead. Now if you'd like to keep yours, hand it over."
[F6-01] "I see you're a man who thinks ahead. I bow before your wisdom, and hope you share your warm brew with a fellow traveler in need."
[F7-01] "Aaaahhhh... Magical and tasty."
[F8-01] "That may be something you'll want to put on the warning label."
[F9-01] "Oh, the old fake peddler trick! My mother always warned me to be careful who I drink with... or is it whom?"
[FA-01] "As long as my arse is warm."
[FB-01] "For some reason I don't share your enthusiasm."
[FC-01] "Nobody asked you!"
[FD-01] "No, I was talking to... Never mind."
[FE-01] "Yes, you do hear someone. Whether it's your rescuer is up for negotiation."
[FF-01] "Hello? Can you hear me? Who are you?"
[00-02] "From the sound of you, I doubt you could offer me neither coin nor cleavage. Hardly worth my time."
[01-02] "I've no way to knock down a wall of ice but let me take a look around to see if I can find anything that might help to free you. Don't go away."
[02-02] "I thought you were dead, or do you always emit that stench?"
[03-02] "You still there my trapped friend?"
[04-02] "Sure. Now stand back while I chisel you out with my bare hands. In the mean time, do you have anything useful to tell me about this place?"
[05-02] "I haven't just yet, do you have any clue as to where I might find something to help get you out?"
[06-02] "Are you still wasting oxygen?"
[07-02] "I'm thankful you're still alive."
[08-02] "You sound like someone who just climbed out from under a rock, I'm surprised you aren't better at exploring underground. Are you sure you don't have any information for me?"
[09-02] "I'm doing all I can for you. Is there any other information you can give me that may help?"
[0A-02] "I admire your ability to cling to life under circumstances where most would have died. Kind of like a cockroach."
[0B-02] "You still there?"
[0C-02] "Just making sure you haven't died. If someone walked in and found me talking to myself, I'd be so embarrassed."
[0D-02] "Just making sure you're still in good health."
[0E-02] "This looks like just the thing I'll need to get through those doors with the big Ravens in front of them. And what's this? A map eh? Let's see... been there, been there... ah, Dounby that looks interesting."
[0F-02] "Let's see, hmm... Dead viking holding the stone I need. Hmm... You're sure you're not gonna come to life on me are you?"
[10-02] "Hello? Gonna wake up on me?"
[11-02] "Oh come on, we both know you're going to spring to life when I least expect it. May as well get it over with and do it now."
[12-02] "I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. You northmen just don't seem to know when to stay dead!"
[13-02] "Maybe not Valhalla but I'll see you back in your grave soon enough."
[14-02] "Is it me? Or did it suddenly just get hot in here?"
[15-02] "If not then take me instead."
[16-02] "ooh just got a little colder."
[17-02] "What happened?"
[18-02] "Hahahahahahaha! That's priceless that is! I only wish that I could have been there. Hahahahaha."
[19-02] "That's a shame about being trapped in this tomb and all but no sense in both of us being stuck here. Why don't you lend me that stone so I can get out of here?"
[1A-02] "I'm sorry, I don't think I made myself clear. Hand over the stone or I'll gut you!"
[1B-02] "Won't you please give me the stone?"
[1C-02] "I may not be able to beat you but I can make what little life you have left here unbearable!"
[1D-02] "You call yourself a viking? Are you going to sulk in your little chair or are you going to do something about your problem?"
[1E-02] "I'll bet you couldn't harm a trow. Berserker? Don't make me laugh."
[1F-02] "Beginner's Luck!"
[20-02] "You mean thawed out."
[21-02] "Bah, I'm just surprised you can count that high."
[22-02] "Hehe hardly worth mentioning, but now that you bring up numbers, I believe you're behind."
[23-02] "Isn't it about time for you to fall on your sword?"
[24-02] "Shall I take a nap while you catch up?"
[25-02] "Keeping up is a relative term."
[26-02] "I was about to ask you the same thing!"
[27-02] "Wait a minute I defeated plenty of enemies. Aren't you going to take me?"
[28-02] "Oh come on, can't we talk this over? I mean we could just go over there into one of those chambers and have a private discussion about it."
[29-02] "What? But how am I going to get out of here?"
[2A-02] "Ah I knew you..."
[2B-02] "Yikes, I was expecting someone a little more... human I guess."
[2C-02] "And what is that?"
[2D-02] "I'll take looks thank you very much."
[2E-02] "Yes you do."
[2F-02] "I'd prefer a more tangible reward right now, if you don't mind."
[30-02] "Hey I'm not kidding! You better have something for me or I'll drag you back here and stick you behind the ice!"
[31-02] "Hmm that wall doesn't look like it's in good shape, I suppose they just don't build frozen tombs full of vengeful walking corpses like they used to."
[32-02] "You have no idea how much it warms my heart to hear that from you.  Give me a moment to write this down in my diary."
[33-02] "You again? Let's put an end to this."
[34-02] "Tough talk from a man with a small army behind him. Are you that fearful of me?"
[35-02] "Better'n fighting like a trow!"
[36-02] "I'll take those odds!"
[37-02] "I have but one question.  Who wants to die first?"
[38-02] "That was quite unpleasant.  Last time I take vacation suggestions from a Trow."
[39-02] "Speak of the devil."
[3A-02] "Don't get your knickers in a bunch, a deal's a deal.  Here's your precious sword.  Now your end of the bargain if you please."
[3B-02] "Ah the sword. I agree, it does belong in your possession. Allow me to repay you for your hospitality earlier. Here, catch!"
[3C-02] "Not very good reflexes at all my friend.   Well you know what they say, live and learn, or in your case..."
[3D-02] "What's the hold up sir?"
[3E-02] "Really?  Did you know that cold is just a state of mind?"
[3F-02] "In fact, my cousin once said that most body heat escapes through his head. So, if your feet are cold, put on a hat."
[40-02] "Will do!"
[41-02] "So you're the one giving us such trouble. To tell you the truth I am a bit surprised, I expected you to be more... formidable."
[42-02] "Since I control your fate, I don't think I really need to be asked. Don't you agree?"
[43-02] "If you're speaking to your maker, you might want to mention you'll be seeing him very soon. Farewell."
[44-02] "To tell you the truth I didn't expect to see you here, I congratulate you on making it this far, perhaps there is more to you than first meets the eye."
[45-02] "Ever the spirited one, eh? Your jibes won't help you now."
[46-02] "Such bravado. I wonder, can you back it up?"
[47-02] "We'll see how afraid I am. Leave The Bard to me! Prepare yourself!"
[48-02] "Apparently you do... kill him!"
[49-02] "Get him!"
[4A-02] "I'll kill you myself then!"
[4B-02] "Oh my goodness! Can it be? Do I hear my rescuer?"
[4C-02] "And they say chivalry is dead.  Listen, oh valiant one, I've been exploring this tomb for weeks and everything was peaceful until a few days ago when these undead Draugr started rising up. I got caught in a cave-in as I was tryin' ta get outta this bloody place. Can you get me out of here?"
[4D-02] "Ah there is someone there; I feared I was goin' mad. I've been exploring this tomb for weeks and everything was peaceful until a few days ago when these undead Draugr started rising up. I got caught in a cave-in as I was tryin' ta get outta this bloody place. Can you get me out of here?"
[4E-02] "Even without laying eyes upon you, it's easy to see how your mind works. Despite not having what you desire, I may be able to offer something you can actually use in this forsaken place."
[4F-02] "From where I sit, I can't be choosy of my saviors. Get me out, and I can reward you."
[50-02] "Thank you stranger. I don't have much but if you can get me out, I'll have a reward for ya."
[51-02] "Oh good, my hero."
[52-02] "Listen, maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Allow me to humbly say... HELP ME!"
[53-02] "Are you still there? Did you find a way to help me?"
[54-02] "I'm sorry, did you say something?  I have a nasty habit of phasing out unintelligible drivel.  Did you find a way to get me out?"
[55-02] "Did you find a way to get me out?"
[56-02] "Yes, you don't want to be where I am.  Hope that helps."
[57-02] "There's a strange stone I found that may be of use to you, had a raven carved on it, I'm guessing its a key of some sort.  If you walk north you may stumble onto it. Or wait... is north the bottomless pit.  I can't remember. Well, walk north, I'm sure it will please one of us."
[58-02] "I had a strange stone that I found in here, had a raven carved in it, very nice work, I think it was some sort of a key. I left it in my camp, had to run away from the Draugr. It may prove useful to you."
[59-02] "Quiet out there. I'm praying you break your leg."
[5A-02] "Ok Listen, are you my savior or my torturer? Get off that damn fence!"
[5B-02] "Thank goodness you've returned."
[5C-02] "No, I think that's you."
[5D-02] "Please help me. I don't think I can take this much longer."
[5E-02] "Sure. See that large rock above you.  All you need to do is stand under it, then scream as loud as you can."
[5F-02] "You and I will have to have a long talk about manners when I get out."
[60-02] "I've got another of those strange keystones on me, found it in the cave-in. Shaped a little different from the other one though, has a carving of a tree on it."
[61-02] "I pray and pray, and yet he still lives."
[62-02] "Don't you have someone else you can give false hope to today?"
[63-02] "Bless your soul for your valiant persistence."
[64-02] "I owe it all to you my friend. I live for nothing else but to disappoint you."
[65-02] "I'm not likely to be goin' anywhere soon. Not physically anyway."
[66-02] "If you find me suffering, I ask but one favor of you. There is a poisonous pill in my left pocket. To put me out of my misery, remove it, and then swallow it!"
[67-02] "What kind of a bard are you anyways?"
[68-02] "I'm fine for now, but please try to hurry."
[69-02] "Good luck getting out of here you obnoxious halfwit."
[6A-02] "Thanks for freeing me friend, I knew you could do it! I have this stone here that'll get us through some of these doors, just lead me to em and I'll unlock em if I can."
[6B-02] "Bah, you humans place too much emphasis on looks, we firbolgs know what is best in life."
[6C-02] "To dig deep in the earth, uncover rich veins of ore, the satisfaction of a hard day's labor."
[6D-02] "At least I got out of that place first..."
[6E-02] "I never though I'd make it out of there alive, and I owe it all to you."
[6F-02] "Good Luck my friend if you should ever find yourself in Stromness look me up. I owe you one."
[70-02] "Ah you kidder! Farewell."
[71-02] "Welcome to my humble camp good sir. Could I interest you in a sword? This particular sword was once used by the great hero Peredur to..."
[72-02] "Ah, you are an observant man I see."
[73-02] "This brew allows me and me arse to ignore the affects of any cold."
[74-02] "Ye may try and may very well succeed, but I'd hate to see the last o' this precious brew spill upon the very earth which will entomb yer frozen arse for eternity."
[75-02] "But would you be my friend if I didn't have something you very much needed?"
[76-02] "No need to expend yer energy my rude rogue, but ye will need to expend some silver for this warming brew."
[77-02] "I'm going to assume the cold is making ya cranky, and share my brew for a fair and heavily discounted price."
[78-02] "Very well, you seem to be a kind enough soul.  Please take a generous swig of me magical brew, on the house."
[79-02] "Aye, and let us not forget potentially deadly."
[7A-02] "I be Gower and ye've fallen right into me trap! Now let's discuss the true price of that brew."
[7B-02] "Now that ye've drunk from me jug, yer under gesa. Unless this curse is broken, ye will remain a prisoner of this mountain wasteland for eternity."
[7C-02] "In the mountains lies the sword Casgair, a sword fated to be me doom. Ye will fetch me this sword, and only then will this curse be lifted to set you free. In layman's terms, give it to me, or die on this mountain."
[7D-02] "Ye're un-pleasantries aren't over me lad. I see you have my sword, now hand it over."
[7E-02] "Aye its me and must I remind you of me gesa... but as promised it will be lifted once you give me that sword!"
[7F-02] "At last! She's a beauty, isn't she? Thank you me friend. Sorry for the way I went about business, but it seemed the only way. As for my end of the deal, not only is the gesa no longer, but here is another token of me appreciation. Oh an ye'll need a sword to defend yerself."
[80-02] "Bah you ruin Hrafn's surprise! But you'll not steal Hrafn's keystone little man."
[81-02] "It'll take better than you to send Hrafn to Valhalla."
[82-02] "A Valkyrie! Have you come to take Hrafn to Valhalla at last?"
[83-02] "But that wasn't Hrafn's fault! It could have happened to anyone."
[84-02] "Hrafn gutted himself on his own sword."
[85-02] "Enough out of you..."
[86-02] "Bah if Hrafn not getting out of here you certainly aren't."
[87-02] "A threat only works if you can make good on it, you can't beat Hrafn little man."
[88-02] "No."
[89-02] "Go away little man you bother Hrafn."
[8A-02] "Don't make Hrafn angry, Bard. Hrafn is a berserker you know."
[8B-02] "What??!!!? Hrafn will show you what he can do! Show Hrafn some enemies, Hrafn will kill them all."
[8C-02] "Hah! One down Bard, you ever see a head fly that far before?"
[8D-02] "Hrafn is just getting warmed up!"
[8E-02] "You see that?"
[8F-02] "Who's tomb is this? That's right its Hrafn's tomb!"
[90-02] "Beat that!"
[91-02] "Now Hrafn does what Hrafn does best!"
[92-02] "Who wants some more? Are you keeping up with Hrafn Bard?"
[93-02] "There Bard! Now you see that Hrafn is no weakling! Now Hrafn will head back to Hrafn's throneroom... to brood."
[94-02] "Praise Woden, it's off to Valhalla, a fight everyday and a feast every night until Ragnarok comes."
[95-02] "Farewell Bard, you were a worthy foe and a true friend, you can have Hrafn's stone."
[96-02] "I hope you don't mind me saying that I'm impressed with the curse put upon you.  Quite deadly, and quite powerful. If I were you, I'd either fetch this sword of which he speaks, or make out your will. Wow... very impressive. Some fine work there."
[97-02] "Get him Cathbad!"
[98-02] "Show him what for!"
[99-02] "Ooooh I bet that hurt!"
[9A-02] "You fight like an old woman!"
[9B-02] "4 to 1 odds against the Bard any takers?"
[9C-02] "Kill him!"
[9D-02] "Smash him!"
[9E-02] "And so The Bard journeyed into the treacherous mountains, not knowing what horrors would await him among the craggy peaks..."
[9F-02] "A winter storm raged in the mountains stopping dead the progress of The Bard who had no way to protect himself from the bitter cold."
[A0-02] "Our esteemed hero was a trifle slow in realizing that he could make no progress in the face of the frigid storm."
[A1-02] "Oh for heavens sake, you can't go in that direction until you have some way to stay warm you dolt!"
[A2-02] "For once, to everyone's amazement and approval, the Bard was speechless."
[A3-02] "Our hero was under a potent spell, and had to obey the command of the Trow or suffer a horrible demise."
[A4-02] "The magic of the Trow was indeed potent."
[A5-02] "As much as I like seeing you in pain, I'd suggest you go get that sword."
[A6-02] "That makes two of us."
[A7-02] "Remembering the curse of the Trow, the Bard strode forward to draw the sword from its icy abode."
[A8-02] "As I said... remembering the curse of the Trow, the Bard strode forward to draw the sword from its' icy abode."
[A9-02] "Oh pull the bloody thing out already!"
[AA-02] "Behold the fabled sword Casgair freed from centuries of imprisonment in the ice by the hand of our brave hero."
[AB-02] "Ah... my favorite part of our tale."
[AC-02] "The Bard awoke in a strange darkened room, not realizing where he was or how he got there.  If only I had a piece of silver for every time that happened."
[AD-02] "As one can see, the Bard was even annoying to the long deceased."
[AE-02] "As well as our strapping hero had done with the mortal ladies, he found himself having no luck with norse warrior godesses."
[AF-02] "The Bard journeyed through the Tomb of the undead Jarl and emerged once again into the light."
[B0-02] "And so having broken the curse our hero continued on his way to the mountain tower."
[B1-02] "And so having broken the curse and with a new, albeit slightly used sword in hand, our hero continued on his way to the mountain tower."
[B2-02] "This is just shoddy workmanship if you ask me.  Why in my day anyone who woulda built a tomb like this woulda been the first buried in it."
[B3-02] "Doesn't that just figure? Anyone capable of swiveling their empty head from side to side these days considers themselves an explorer. Why in my day, that guy wouldn't have been fit to explore a three-foot hole in the ground."
[B4-02] "Ooooh that sounded painful and I oughta know a little something about pain."
[B5-02] "I have not Hrafn. You have not earned your way into Valhalla."
[B6-02] "He was a very skilled and fearless fighter in life, destined to win much glory for himself. His brothers were organizing a raid up the coast and celebrated their impending victory with a great feast. This one got himself so blinding drunk he stumbled and..."
[B7-02] "Indeed it was no laughing matter, for now Hrafn cannot enter Valhalla. Until he proves his valor in combat, he cannot leave this tomb."
[B8-02] "Hrafn it is time to go, you have proven yourself."
[B9-02] "Not a chance."
[BA-02] "Not even when I was mortal. In any case you have more to do in this world before you move onto the next, farewell."
[BB-02] "Let me give you some knowledge that may help you escape this place."
[BC-02] "Don't spoil the moment. Ok Hrafn let's go, next stop Valhalla."
[1A-0B] "You'll never have the stone Bard... the only way Hrafn would give it to you is if Hrafn was going to Valhalla and that is never..."
[1B-0B] "I'm glad that business is over with... now about that keystone..."
[B4-0E] "Hello... what have we got here? A chest in the middle of nowhere. Obviously a trap. You know I'm not going to be lured in by such an obvious ploy!"
[B5-0E] "Oh... what the hell."
[B6-0E] "All too easy."
[B7-0E] "Damn I fall for that every time. I knew it was a trap!"
[A9-12] "Hrafn's Kills"
[6C-13] "Press [7D-00] to launch raft."
[7E-13] "The Bard had apparantly angered the trapped Firbolg into a rash action leading to an unfortunate accident."
[7F-13] "Unfortunate for him... Very fortunate for me. I can use some of these things."
[80-13] "The grateful Firbolg handed over the Keystone that he had found in his earlier exploration of the Tombs."
[81-13] "Aaaaargh..."
[87-14] "The Bard knew better than to venture too deeply into the Tombs with this new companion slowing him down. He needed to escort this unlucky Firbolg out to the surface."
[88-14] "The shattered keystone however was of no use to the Bard."
[89-14] "The Bard had to find some way to be rid of his undead companion before leaving the area."
[8A-14] "Press [7D-00] to inspect undead viking."
[B5-14] "Press [7D-00] to inspect the abandoned camp."
[B6-14] "The Bard found a somewhat recently abandoned camp and as he was wont to do in these situations, started looting it."
