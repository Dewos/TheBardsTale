[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[CA-08] "As the Bard drew closer to the Tower in the forest, a scene of great concern to him would play itself out atop another tower, in the city of Dounby, many leagues away..."
[CB-08] "Cathbad, Gather the brothers. Someone is nearing the first tower."
[CC-08] "At once sir."
[CD-08] "Mackay... wake my... pet."
[CF-08] "Unknowingly caught between the hammer and the anvil our hero entered the tower."
[D0-08] "Uh oh... look I don't want any trouble."
[D1-08] "Turn around and walk the other way for if you seek entrance into this place, trouble is all you shall find."
[D2-08] "Typical. I thought you might say something like that. I'm afraid I have to proceed, I've got quite the reward waiting for me when I finish this nonsense."
[D3-08] "I shall give my warning once more, turn back or perish."
[D4-08] "Those aren't very appealing choices, I'm gonna have to go with neither."
[D5-08] "Very well, I await you at the top. If you survive."
[D6-08] "As promised, Herne met the Bard atop the tower. If the bard wished the flame of the tower extinguished, he would first have to extinguish the life of its guardian."
[D7-08] "You may have made it this far, but your journey ends here. Prepare to die."
[D8-08] "Die? I've got too much to live for, but an old weed like yourself wouldn't understand such things, time to do a little gardening I think."
[D9-08] "I knew you wouldn't let me down."
[DA-08] "I bet you'd have said that to any other guy... had any lived to make it this far."
[DB-08] "The others paled in comparison to you."
[DC-08] "Looked like most of them were impaled actually."
[DD-08] "Yet you survived the journey up the tower."
[DE-08] "Yes, but I have a few choice words for the gardener."
[DF-08] "Stay valiant my love. You need now go to the second tower which you can reach by taking a dangerous and peril filled journey through the mountains."
[E0-08] "I don't suppose you have a map."
[E1-08] "If only I did. You will need to go back to Kirkwall and see Bodb."
[E2-08] "Does the term vicious circle mean anything to you?"
[E3-08] "He is waiting for you and will guide you through the mountains. A different instrument is needed to enter the Mountain Tower, Bodb knows of its location and can help you obtain it on your way through. Be certain to take the Spirit Stone of Herne, his power will now be added to your own."
[E4-08] "You better be damn rich, that's all I can say."
[E5-08] "More than you will be able to spend in your lifetime,  my love. But you must hurry, the next torch must be put out soon."
[E6-08] "Speaking of putting out..."
[E7-08] "Hurry my champion."
[E8-08] "I hate it when she does that."
[E9-08] "Listen, take it from a woman.  That was the biggest bunch of garbage I've ever heard.  You're not going to fall for that damsel in distress routine are you?"
[EA-08] "Well... I don't know... maybe."
[EB-08] "Just like a man.  Her with the perfect hair, perfect little face, and I guess her body's halfway decent.  She's playing you for a fool if you ask me."
[EC-08] "She seemed sincere."
[ED-08] "Yeah, to which brain?"
[EE-08] "The Bard had no time for rest, for the danger of this tower had not yet passed."
[EF-08] "It's so hard to be right all of the time."
[F0-08] "Harder for me than you, I assure you."
[52-0B] "To enter the tower the Bard had need of the ornate lute which he could find in the possession of the kunal trow Fnarf."
[FA-0E] "Hold on... damn! Why do I have to go all the way to the top? He was just here, he certainly knew I was coming."
[FB-0E] "Evil it seems has a flair for the dramatic."
