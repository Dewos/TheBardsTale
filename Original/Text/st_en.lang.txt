[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[AD-07] "As the Bard approached the small Viking town, it was apparent that things were dead... literally. Hell had already made its way to Stromness, and the Bard as usual, was right on its tail."
[AE-07] "We don't allow your kind in here."
[AF-07] "And what kind is that? Bards?"
[B0-07] "No... the living."
[B1-07] "You mean the only way to get into this town is to die?"
[B2-07] "Yes... however we can help you out with that, free of charge."
[B3-07] "Quite neighborly of you."
[B4-07] "We aim to please."
[B5-07] "I don't want any trouble. God knows I've had more than my fair share. All I want to do is get to that island with the big tower. Do you know the way?"
[B6-07] "The only way is through this town, or I should say, was through this town... through the Firbolg mines. But it needn't concern you, you'll not stay alive long, nobody does."
[B7-07] "Well, other than that crazy old butcher and the shopkeeper, we've been having a little trouble getting to them."
[B8-07] "Yes, good ol' Hatcher the butcher.  He's been nuts ever since he was driven off his farm."
[B9-07] "Here's how I see it. I need to get to the island. So... I might as well just fight you... because whether I live or die, I get in."
[BA-07] "You have a point there."
[BB-07] "Obviously. Shall we begin?"
[BC-07] "It soon became clear to the Bard that in Stromness a population boom was in progress. Whenever he killed one Draugr, there was another popping up to take its place. Our hero was in a definite die/die situation."
[BD-07] "Ever the stubborn one, the Bard refused the help of the Butcher, even at the risk of being overwhelmed by the Draugr horde."
[BE-07] "You must be that crazy old butcher I've heard about."
[BF-07] "Ah I thought I'd never see you again!"
[C0-07] "Excuse me."
[C1-07] "Don't play games with me Garret, I thought I remembered the Draugr getting you but I guess I was wrong cause here you are!"
[C2-07] "I think you've got the wrong person."
[C3-07] "Don't be stupid how could I not know my own brother?"
[C4-07] "Ah, yes well then I guess you're right. It's been a long time eh... brother."
[C5-07] "Yes it has been. It's been rough these last few weeks trying to survive alone, well there's the old shopkeeper, but he's crazy."
[C6-07] "It's a shame when your only companion is a crazy person isn't it?"
[C7-07] "You can say that again why ever since... my boy... my only son..."
[C8-07] "You all right there... brother?"
[C9-07] "What? William? William! It is you! Oh my son I can't believe its you I thought you lost. When you went off looking for that axe..."
[CA-07] "Oh gods, get off of me old man."
[CB-07] "No shame in public affection my boy, you're my only son and there's nobody else around well nobody living, except maybe that crazy shopkeep..."
[CC-07] "I hate to interrupt... father... but do you know the way to the Firbolg mines?"
[CD-07] "What? Of course I do my boy you know our farm is right next to the mine entrance. Why our families' been trading with those Firbolg for generations."
[CE-07] "Great! Let's go to the farm...dad. Ummm you had better lead the way all this excitement has caused me to forget which way it is."
[CF-07] "We must head through the graveyard."
[D0-07] "Of course, naturally through the graveyard.  Just once it would be nice if the way to get someplace was through a field of flowers."
[D1-07] "The Bard couldn't help but think that once this was all over he had a new friend he could share a drink with. He was in fact quite overwhelmed by the thrill of spending hours on end with the Crazy ol' Butcher..."
[D2-07] "Oh shut up! That's not what I'm thinking and you know it!"
[D3-07] "What was that son?"
[D4-07] "Nothing... you crazy old buzzard... I mean father."
[D5-07] "Good Day to you my traveling friend, you are either very brave, or very stupid to be wandering around this town today. In case you haven't noticed the dead seem to be rising from their graves."
[D6-07] "Really?  I hadn't noticed.  I'm just out scouting locations for some land to build a house on. I was thinking of retiring here."
[D7-07] "I'm neither Brave, nor stupid, just a humble traveler looking for a way into the Firbolg Mines."
[D8-07] "Ha Ha a sarcastic one are you? A man I can relate to. Perhaps I can help you with a magical tune, if you think you're worthy"
[D9-07] "If that's your intent then you really are stupid. The Finfolk in the Mines will make this town look like a walk in the park."
[DA-07] "Thus far on this journey I've only met two types of people, those that have helped me and those that I've killed.  Which type are you?"
[DB-07] "I'll worry about the Finfolk when I get there, but right now I need to deal with the undead.  Is there anything you can do to help?"
[DC-07] "Thus far on this journey I've only met two types of people, those that have helped me and those that I've killed.  Which type are you?"
[DD-07] "I don't know if I'm worthy, but I do know I could use the help. Please just give me the tune, and I'll use it well."
[DE-07] "Excellent! It'll be my honor to help out a nasty sort of man like yourself. Please take this tune and use it in good health."
[DF-07] "Sorry, I don't think I can help you, but I will give you some advice.  I have a brother who hangs out near the Store, he might be inclined to help a nice lad like yourself.  Now off with you, leave me to my music."
[E0-07] "Over here...  You'll be safe!"
[E1-07] "You can't beat them, but I can help you from joining them."
[E2-07] "Well I'm glad that's over with. Things seem much quieter over here."
[E3-07] "Yes, they do, Hilde when did you get here? Oh my wife! Give us a kiss."
[E4-07] "You so much as come anywhere near me, I'm gonna knock you out."
[E5-07] "It is you! You never change my love."
[E6-07] "With that, the Bard found himself thinking that..."
[E7-07] "Stop telling me what I'm thinking!"
[E8-07] "Go away! Can't you read?"
[E9-07] "I'm a traveler who needs to purchase some wares."
[EA-07] "Ha! I've fallen for that one before. Are you dead?"
[EB-07] "Do I sound dead?"
[EC-07] "Yes!"
[ED-07] "I assure you I'm not. Just let me in."
[EE-07] "Well you see I can't take that chance. If you go and grab that crazy butcher and bring him back with you, I will let you in. I trust him."
[EF-07] "You don't trust me, but you trust a crazy butcher... That makes sense."
[F0-07] "Crazy is my middle name.  Now go away!"
[F1-07] "I don't see the Butcher with you. Go away!"
[F2-07] "The Crazy ol' Butcher had become feared by the dead, trusted by the living... Enigma comes to mind, but I try not to use big words in front of the Bard."
[F3-07] "I understand, I understand... the butcher is a small lizard like creature."
[F4-07] "I rest my case."
[F5-07] "It's Ok my friend.  It's me Hatcher and my wife Hilde... let us in."
[F6-07] "Oh yes, how silly of me. You're looking as lovely as ever Hilde."
[F7-07] "I'm going to kill somebody pretty soon."
[F8-07] "Ah and the same lovely temperament."
[F9-07] "Welcome to Thorvald's! If I'm crazy enough to stay in this town, then I'm crazy enough to slash my prices! If we don't have it here, you don't want it. And if you can get it somewhere else, you don't need it. And if you can find it cheaper, I will eat my helmet."
[FA-07] "It's small! It's effective!  Hide it in your boot, hide it up your sleeve.  This dirk is made from the finest vipersteel imbued with a deadly venom, and it's guaranteed to kill your foes and I will swallow it whole if it doesn't serve you well, my friend! Am I crazy?!"
[FB-07] "Ah the dirk. Good choice. Please come again."
[FC-07] "You have seen ravensteel broadswords in the hands of great warriors, great kings, and men of legend. Well quit admiring this amazing weapon in the hands of others and own your very own... today! I'm offering it at an insane price today only!"
[FD-07] "The broadsword, very nice. And remember, if you see it cheaper elsewhere, then that's crazy."
[FE-07] "Stop! Look no further! You see it, you want it, you need it! And you'll be the envy of all those who flail with this Onyx model. It will permeate, it will radiate, so do not hesitate! Buy it now!"
[FF-07] "Excellent choice with the flail my friend. We also sell extended warranties if you're interested."
[00-08] "It slices. It dices. And it can be yours my friend. Frecraid, the sword of kings... No, no, no, no the sword of gods! It's beautifully balanced, and the ladies will be clamoring for you and your sword! Size does matter!"
[01-08] "You get more with a Claymore."
[02-08] "You want distance? You want accuracy? Are we out of our mind?  Well, we must be to let such a fine bow go at such a crazy, crazy, crazy price!"
[03-08] "Remember every time you use this long bow that your money goes a long way here at Thorvald's."
[04-08] "Thump! Thump! Thump! What is that sound? Thump! Thump! Thump! Why it's the arrows from your brand new bow slamming into the chest of your greatest enemies. And even as they perish, they will be proud to have been slain by such fine merchandise."
[05-08] "Please, tell your friends that you got that bow at an insane price!"
[06-08] "You think you're a man who has everything?  Well believe me, you have nothing until you own this Bow. Hewn from the legendary tree Bile Dathi it's sleek, it's powerful, and it can be yours for an absolutely mad price!"
[07-08] "Yes, the legendary one of a kind Bow of Bile Dathi. I own three myself."
[08-08] "Now you can't get these in Houton. You can't get these in Finstown. You can only get them here!  Why?  Because I went mad and I bought the entire stock from shops all around the world!"
[09-08] "Wear that that mail with pride my friend."
[0A-08] "Don't blink! Don't Breathe! Just admire this fine mail. Close your eyes. Feel it! Visualize it! Now buy it!"
[0B-08] "That Mail may be bronze, but you can always take home some extra silver here at Thorvald's."
[0C-08] "Block with style! Block with grace! And be the first one on your block to own the newest Targ Shield! Why own this years model when you can have the next years model... Right now!  Futuristic baby!"
[0D-08] "That shield will block an enemies sword just like we block high prices here at Thorvald's!"
[0E-08] "You will be the talk of the town my friend, heck, you will be the talk of the whole countryside sporting this shield. And, if you buy it now within the next ten minutes, I'll throw in the handle for free! Am I nuts or what?"
[0F-08] "You won't find a better deal anywhere! You enjoy that free handle."
[10-08] "Today only, it's the Crazy Thorvald's Music sale.  Buy this instrument today, and I'll throw in a piece of music that I found on the dead body of some kid who wandered into town not so long ago for free. That's right, for one low price you get the horn, and this tune. Yes, you couldn't live another day without owning this amazing instrument."
[11-08] "Enjoy the instrument, and the music, and don't forget to tell all your friends to shop here at Crazy Thorvalds."
[12-08] "Good Day to you my friend, you must be lost to find yourself in this god forsaken town. It seems that the dead are not doing a very good job of staying dead."
[13-08] "Your amazing grasp of the obvious is inspiring.  I just don't know what I'd do with out your help"
[14-08] "Don't worry my friend, I won't be staying long, my quest lies elsewhere."
[15-08] "Don't worry my sarcastic friend; my help is something you'll not be getting any time soon."
[16-08] "Oh, a quest!  How exciting! Perhaps I can help you with a magical tune, if you think you're worthy."
[17-08] "I don't think you really want to test my worthiness, in my travels I have bettered many a foe who was stronger than you."
[18-08] "I don't know how worthy I am, but I do know I could use the help.  If you'd be so kind, I can use all the help I can get."
[19-08] "Listen here trow, I've had just about enough of all the double talk today.  If you have something that will help me hand it over."
[1A-08] "I'm sorry if I offended you, my journey has been long and hard.  Look, if you have something that would make it easier for me, it would be most appreciated."
[1B-08] "Sorry, I don't think I can help you, but I'll give you some advice. I have a brother who hangs out near the Kirk. He might be inclined to help a sarcastic lad like yourself.  Now off with you, leave me to my music"
[1C-08] "It'd be my pleasure and honor to help a nice lad such as yourself. Please let me teach you this tune, I hope it'll help you on your journey."
[1D-08] "As the Bard and his best friend, father, brother and husband approached the farm, things were eerily quiet.  Soon however, the Bard witnessed the sight that had driven Hatcher from his farm.  People weren't the only things rising from the dead, and these hacked up animals were quite annoyed at how they had been treated by the butcher. There was a strong case here for a vegetarian lifestyle."
[1E-08] "I have something that will help! Father's old bow! This way brother!"
[1F-08] "Back to brother is it? Better than Hilde I suppose."
[20-08] "Hello, this can't be good. What on earth did you bury here brother?"
[21-08] "Oh my!  That's where I buried all the animal parts I didn't need."
[22-08] "You know, I really don't like the sound of that."
[23-08] "Quite Frankly, I don't like the looks of it either."
[24-08] "Haggis for everyone!"
[25-08] "Ok old man, I'd love to stay for the family barbeque and all, but first I think I need to see the mines, ok?"
[26-08] "Oh of course Father, of course."
[27-08] "Father eh? I'm moving up in the world... lead on my son."
[28-08] "Of course."
[29-08] "How about giving me that weapon you have there, Isn't that mine anyways?"
[2A-08] "Of course father I thought you might want it back some day."
[2B-08] "Great, now to the mines."
[2C-08] "As promised, the Bard's new relative lead him to the Firbolg mines. It brings a tear to the eye that these close family members must part ways forever."
[2D-08] "See you old man... And may I suggest you go into the flower growing business."
[2E-08] "Farewell Hilde!"
[2F-08] "With that, the Bard walked into the Firbolg mines. Each footfall brought him one step closer to his destiny, but one step further from the very special bond he had formed with his beloved butcher."
[30-08] "Sometimes I really hate you!"
[E2-09] "This way brother!"
[E3-09] "Grannie! Come on, Grannie, bust those bunions would ya."
[E4-09] "Hilde, come this way!"
[E5-09] "Oooo! I can still smell Misty's sweet buns! Best bakery in town."
[E6-09] "You look a lot like the trow I just talked to..."
[E7-09] "What? Oh you must mean my brother... I assure you we've never met before, Trow's honor."
[E8-09] "That's a contradiction if ever I heard one."
[E9-09] "Sir, you wound me."
[EA-09] "We'll see about that..."
[EB-09] "I can see that yer either very brave or very stupid to be stumbling around this accursed town."
[EC-09] "No need for such fierce talk lad, I'm yer friend and you could use a friend in this town for the dead be rising from their graves of late."
[ED-09] "You want armor or you want amor? If you want armor I've got armor! I've got crazy armor at insanely low prices!"
[EE-09] "Swords! Flails! Dirks! And you gotta be out of your mind to go out of here without one of my melee weapons at your side!"
[EF-09] "Melee combat not working out for you? Why you would be insane not to consider picking up one of my bows!"
[2B-0A] "Garret where have you been? Let's go home!"
[2C-0A] "Old man McMorty lived in this house. Heard his son was a chosen one, just like you."
[2D-0A] "This is the tree that I fell out of and broke my wrist."
[2E-0A] "This is the spot, Garret. Were I found  the body of ole Toradil Jones. Gives me a shiver. Never seen a real dead body before. Hopefully, you'll never have to."
[2F-0A] "William, gather all your friends for cake and pie, then we'll open gifts."
[DB-0A] "Hatcher has been slain."
[ED-0A] "Papa, I wish you and your mighty bow could defend us right now."
[EE-0A] "Okay love muffin, but remember our deal.  Whatever you buy, you have to model for me when we get home!"
[EF-0A] "Poor Bessy Mae!  I remembered when she died there wasn't enough wood to build her coffin."
[F0-0A] "And miss out on all the glorious sales!"
[F1-0A] "I'm finished sweetheart. Do you mind if we swing by the firbolg mines on the way home?"
[24-0B] "What do you have that's pointy and stabby?"
[25-0B] "Crazy Thorvald understands the importance of keeping one's head. And what better way to do that than with some quality armor at insanely cheap prices!"
[26-0B] "Whether you're looking to cut down Kunal Trow or cutting down hedges these items can do the trick!"
[27-0B] "Well I'm crazy, but I'm not stupid. And I see you're the same. These items will do the deed from a distance. Little mess means easy clean up."
[29-0B] "Behemoth has been upgraded."
[2A-0B] "Gouger has been upgraded."
[2B-0B] "The Firbolg Mines have revealed on the World Map."
[2D-0B] "Aren't we lucky it wasn't your neck."
[2E-0B] "I have a feeling my 'friends' are not interested in cake or pie."
[2F-0B] "Really how did he fair?"
[30-0B] "The Draugr split him like a ripe tomato."
[D5-0C] "I'm not leaving this spot until my boy William returns. He went off to Greenlands after the Shadow Axe."
[D6-0C] "I hate to break it to you but he may not return. The world's going to hell in a handbasket in case you hadn't noticed."
[D7-0C] "He's got to return, he's the chosen one."
[E9-0C] "Welcome back to Crazy Thorvalds!"
[EA-0C] "Insane prices, mad deals at Crazy Thorvalds!"
[EB-0C] "My lack of inventory is making me crazy!  Sorry, we're closed... for the day."
[EC-0C] "We have crazy specials on specialty items!"
[EF-0C] "You come back when you can afford my insanely low prices."
[48-0E] "He's as good as dead."
[BC-0E] "William, its your farm now. Here's the key... take care of... Hilde for...me..."
[BD-0E] "The Bard was overcome with grief at the Death of his dear friend. So overcome in fact that he forgot to pick up the key that dropped from Hatcher's lifeless fingers."
[44-12] "Haggis Monster"
[2A-13] "Aggggh! They got me... Son..."
[2B-13] "The Bard fought valiantly to protect the Butcher from the horde of Draugr... Or at least that's what he should have been doing."
[0A-15] "the gate to Hatcher's Farm"
[18-15] "The Bard returned to the Firbolg Mines to find that the entrance had been blocked. The Firbolgs had decided to seal themselves away from the outside world and all its troubles."
[56-15] ""
[57-15] ""
[58-15] ""
[9B-15] "A locked gate impeded the Bard's progress, perhaps our hero could find survivors in the doomed village who might be able to help him."
[9C-15] "With Hatcher slain, the Bard needed to find the entrance to the Firbolg Mines on his own."
[9D-15] "The Bard needed to follow Hatcher and keep him safe. The crazed butcher was the key to finding the Firbolg Mines."
