[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[31-02] "Hmm that wall doesn't look like it's in good shape, I suppose they just don't build frozen tombs full of vengeful walking corpses like they used to."
[32-02] "You have no idea how much it warms my heart to hear that from you.  Give me a moment to write this down in my diary."
[33-02] "You again? Let's put an end to this."
[34-02] "Tough talk from a man with a small army behind him. Are you that fearful of me?"
[35-02] "Better'n fighting like a trow!"
[36-02] "I'll take those odds!"
[37-02] "I have but one question.  Who wants to die first?"
[38-02] "That was quite unpleasant.  Last time I take vacation suggestions from a Trow."
[41-02] "So you're the one giving us such trouble. To tell you the truth I am a bit surprised, I expected you to be more... formidable."
[42-02] "Since I control your fate, I don't think I really need to be asked. Don't you agree?"
[43-02] "If you're speaking to your maker, you might want to mention you'll be seeing him very soon. Farewell."
[44-02] "To tell you the truth I didn't expect to see you here, I congratulate you on making it this far, perhaps there is more to you than first meets the eye."
[45-02] "Ever the spirited one, eh? Your jibes won't help you now."
[46-02] "Such bravado. I wonder, can you back it up?"
[47-02] "We'll see how afraid I am. Leave The Bard to me! Prepare yourself!"
[48-02] "Apparently you do... kill him!"
[49-02] "Get him!"
[4A-02] "I'll kill you myself then!"
[97-02] "Get him Cathbad!"
[98-02] "Show him what for!"
[99-02] "Ooooh I bet that hurt!"
[9A-02] "You fight like an old woman!"
[9B-02] "4 to 1 odds against the Bard any takers?"
[9C-02] "Kill him!"
[9D-02] "Smash him!"
[62-07] "Cathbad is faring poorly in his efforts. This... Bard has already evaded one of his traps and has reached the mountain tower alive. Lugh should be able to handle him but take some of the Brothers and ensure he does not leave the tower alive."
[63-07] "Yes my lord."
[64-07] "See that you don't fail. Use any means necessary to stop him. You know what's at stake."
[65-07] "We will do as you command."
[66-07] "The Bard had battled his way through ice and snow to reach the Mountain Tower. Inside awaited the most deadly adversary he would yet face, the bronze warrior Lugh, second of the tower guardians."
[67-07] "I was wondering when you would get here. I've been anticipating your arrival for some time now. I am of course Lugh, the guardian of this tower, and you are the man that did in old Herne? You seem a bit soft to me."
[68-07] "Obviously a matter of opinion. Look, can we just get this over with? I've a princess to rescue and the sooner you go down the sooner she'll... well, can we just get this over with?"
[69-07] "Princess? Hehe... I admire a man who dies for the woman he loves."
[6A-07] "Who said anything about love?"
[6B-07] "Before we fight, there are a few formalities we must observe. First, would you care to turn back?"
[6C-07] "Turn back? Not bloody likely. Not after everything I've been through. Turning back is not an option, my friend."
[6D-07] "I was hoping you'd say that."
[6E-07] "Behold my arena! Impressive isn't it? Gets your blood flowing and ready to fight just being here."
[6F-07] "There are only two things that really get my blood flowing. One you can't afford and the other would not be socially acceptable. Now how shall we do this?"
[70-07] "Oh it isn't that easy my friend,  remember those formalities I spoke of? You've got to prove yourself worthy before you have the honor of facing me."
[71-07] "If there's any way we can forgo that whole worthy part I'd..."
[72-07] "Let's start with something easy. A real man would be able to defeat my lackeys before time expires."
[73-07] "That was pathetic. Certainly you can do better than that."
[74-07] "Very good, but my youngest sister could have done the same. Now, let's make things more interesting shall we?"
[75-07] "You have to be able to do better than that. Try it again, this time with some effort please."
[76-07] "Now I'm starting to see why you defeated Herne. Let's see how good you really are."
[77-07] "Can't handle it when things get rough I see... I'll give you another try."
[78-07] "Nicely done, very nicely done, not as good as my best time but adequate nonetheless. I wonder, how will you handle a more balanced attack?"
[79-07] "Hahahaha a valiant effort, I enjoy seeing you fail, so I'll give you another chance to do so."
[7A-07] "I can see that you are indeed dangerous. Perhaps a new sort of test is in order."
[7B-07] "What no timer? Are your games over already?  I was just starting to have fun."
[7C-07] "Oh I have one game left, you'll like this one. The goal is simple; make it to the top of the tower alive."
[7D-07] "I'll see you there."
[7E-07] "I hope so. I'd love to deal with you myself, but I doubt you have what it takes."
[7F-07] "The bard took a glimpse into his possible future. He knew that he would need to keep his wits as well as his sword sharp to avoid the fate of the skeletal remains at his feet."
[80-07] "I love it when you state the obvious."
[81-07] "I'll be sure to make better use of this than you did my friend."
[82-07] "Waiting for the Bard of your dreams to wander by Ladies?"
[83-07] "Certainly, we've been waiting for you, waiting to keep you away from this lever."
[84-07] "I was getting ahead of myself when I called you ladies. Your tongue is sharp but if you weren't hiding behind those bars I'll bet you'd sing a different tune."
[85-07] "Please my lasses, as you can see I mean you absolutely no harm, quite the opposite in fact."
[86-07] "You will hear naught from us but scorn and laughter for we are safe behind these bars and are not afraid of anything..."
[87-07] "But Maeve what about... you know?"
[88-07] "I'll hear none of that talk now you silly lass. There are none of those squeekin devils left around here."
[89-07] "Oh I don't think you are up to it. It makes no difference in any case for we will not come out from behind these bars."
[8A-07] "You wenches talk tough but if you weren't hiding behind those bars I'll bet you'd sing a different tune."
[8B-07] "Isn't there any way we can work something out here?"
[8C-07] "You will hear naught from us but scorn and laughter for we are safe behind these bars and are not afraid of anything..."
[8D-07] "But Maeve what about... you know?"
[8E-07] "I'll hear none of that talk now you silly lass. There are none of those squeekin devils left around here."
[8F-07] "Just like a man not to know when he's been beaten.  Now go away."
[90-07] "Just like a man not to know when he's been beaten.  Now go away."
[91-07] "Eeek, it's a rat I can't stand the little squeeking buggers, get me out of here!"
[92-07] "Be brave girl that wee thing cannot hurt you."
[93-07] "Curse you and your verminous allies!"
[94-07] "Once again the Bard oh so valiantly overcame his foes."
[95-07] "It's a gift."
[96-07] "Our brave hero fought his way to the summit of the tower, and before him stood the flame that he must extinguish. Unfortunately, before that stood Lugh, who would not give in without a fight."
[97-07] "You've made it I see."
[98-07] "No taunts now? Where's all that wit I heard down in the arena?"
[99-07] "I've gained a measure of respect for your fighting prowess, It saddens me that I'm going to have to kill you now."
[9A-07] "I wish I could say the feeling's mutual, but the cold fact is, I expect I'll quite enjoy it."
[9B-07] "That's the spirit!"
[9C-07] "My champion, you're here!  I have counted the hours till I..."
[9D-07] "Cut the crap lady. What gives with all the dead refusing to stay dead?"
[9E-07] "Yes, I had feared that would happen."
[9F-07] "I would appreciate it if we discussed all fears up front from now on.  I'm not a big fan of surprises."
[A0-07] "Very well. I should tell you that the denizens of the underworld are rising up, trying to put an end to your quest."
[A1-07] "Why are they after me?"
[A2-07] "They know it was you who defeated Herne. Because of this they know you are trying to set me free. Their leader is a ruthless man who'll stop at nothing to keep you from freeing me."
[A3-07] "Yet again something I wish I knew earlier."
[A4-07] "I'm the only one who can stop them. Until I'm set free, darkness will engulf the land. You must hurry. The longer you take, the more power the forces of evil will gain, soon I won't even be able to hold them back."
[A5-07] "I should have just settled for the farmer's daughter."
[A6-07] "You must get to the Island Tower quickly, time is short. First go to Dounby where you'll find a man named Dugan. He is in a tavern called the Aiken Drum. He will have further instructions for you."
[A7-07] "Oh joy, another journey. Why not tell me where I need to go right now?"
[A8-07] "Dugan is locating an object for you, something of great power, you'll need it to enter the third tower. The fate of the world is in your hands my love."
[A9-07] "As long as there's no pressure involved."
[AA-07] "And more pressures were soon to come. Unbeknownst to the Bard, the servants of the mysterious Fionnaoch were making good on their masters command to stop the Bard at any cost."
[AB-07] "With more and more rubble left in his wake, the Bard continued to Dounby. But would he be in time to save not only his princess but an entire world?"
[AC-07] "I'm sure she was just exagerating... yeah...she's just anxious to see me. Who wouldn't be."
[CC-08] "At once sir."
[4D-0B] "Your advances are for naught!  I guard this lever which controls these gates by which you cannot pass!"
[4E-0B] "There are no keys only levers! And the lever is here because... Errr... damn me for a fool, you're right!"
[4F-0B] "Why do you  guys always put the lever to a gate in front of the area you're trying to protect? Try putting it behind the gate! Next you'll be telling me that the keys to the doors are hidden in some random chests throughout the tower."
[51-0B] "Without the jewelled flute which he should have recovered in the Viking Tombs, the Bard was unable to enter the tower."
[AC-0B] "The world is doomed."
[AD-0B] "Don't be so hard on yourself. I've seen it before, it's a pretty common error... Let me put you out of your misery."
[DF-0B] "Praise Fionnaoch! Another chance to dispatch you! This time you are a dead man!"
[E1-0B] "Die!"
[E5-0B] "But... sir... the Redcaps..."
[E8-0B] "Still thinking..."
[46-0D] "The brothers are assembling my Lord. We await your instructions."
[48-0D] "It will be my pleasure master."
[B6-0E] "All too easy."
[D5-0E] "There he is! The one who killed Fnarf! Get him!"
[AE-11] "Show me what you've got Bard!"
[AF-11] "Take that!"
[B0-11] ""
[B1-11] "Draoi Spraidh!"
[B2-11] ""
[B3-11] "Forgive me master..."
[B4-11] "You're no match for me Bard!"
[B5-11] "Pathetic!"
[70-14] "The ladies that were preventing the Bard from reaching the lever seemed extremely fearful of rodents."
[71-14] "A shame that there were no rats to be found in the area. The Bard excepted of course."
[D6-14] ""
