[54-12] "It was right about this time that the Bard began to regret his inability to procure a ranged weapon. Perhaps thoughts of running to the local store and purchasing a bow were passing through his head?"
[58-12] "The stronger the Bard is, the more damage he can inflict with melee weapons."
[59-12] "A high vitality will increase the Bard's health, making him more difficult to defeat in battle."
[5A-12] "Luck has a subtle effect on many aspects of the Bard's adventures."

[5D-12] "Rhythm allows the Bard to play magical tunes with greater skill, enhancing the statistics of summoned creatures."
[5E-12] "The Bard was as weak as a newborn babe."
[5F-12] "The Bard was neither particularly strong nor weak."
[60-12] "A strapping young man, the Bard possessed a great deal of strength... Physically if not morally."
[61-12] "Able to bend steel bars with his teeth and lift boulders over his head with ease... Well not really, but the Bard was very very strong."
[64-12] "Possessing little vitality, even a common cold was a very real threat to our sickly Hero."
[65-12] "The Bard was of average health and fitness."

[67-12] "Much like an ox or any other large, smelly, mindless animal the Bard possessed a hardy constitution."
[68-12] "The Bard was so unlucky, black cats considered it an ill omen when he crossed their path."
[69-12] "The fates neither smiled nor frowned upon our hero."
[6A-12] "The Bard was very Lucky. How else could one explain how he managed to survive?"
[6B-12] "It seemed as if some higher power were looking after the Bard, granting him the best of luck in even the most dire situations. Damn."
[6C-12] "Whether it was tripping over his own feet or fumbling his bow while trying to equip it, the Bard was always good for a laugh."
[6D-12] "The Bard possessed an average amount of manual dexterity."
[6E-12] "The Bard's quick wit was matched by his equally quick hands."
[6F-12] "Nimble fingers and a steady eye made the Bard a deadly marksman."

[75-12] "The Bard had an average sense of rhythm, which is to say a poor amount for someone claiming to be a musician."
[76-12] "A good sense of rhythm and timing allowed the Bard to truely lay claim to his title."
[77-12] "Virtuoso was the only word to describe someone of the Bard's considerable musical talent."

[14-13] "The legendary Bard Ossian once wore this fine mantle. A great man, respected and loved by the commonfolk as well as the nobles of his time, the name of Ossian inspires others to this day. One could only hope that some of his greatness would rub off on our own Bard, of course one could also hope for sheep to fly."
[15-13] "This charm made from a mixture of copper and silver was enchanted to bring its bearer good health."
[16-13] "A locket made by the wee folk of the southern islands, such charms were often known to bring long life and good health to their bearers. Of course this particular charm also heald a terrible curse... muahahaha... Oh, alright there was no curse but I can dream can't I?"
[17-13] "This glass container held the tears of Queen Medb of Connacht legendary for her battles with the Hero Cuchulainn."
[18-13] "This Charm was enchanted by the Trow Fnarf to aid him with his poor musicianship. Well, its new owner isn't much of a step up from a Trow."

[4A-17] "It had come to this, at last.  One man, a poet and a rogue, with no friends to speak of, no one to mourn his passing should it come to that.  Even those beside him are no more boon companions than bondservants, summoned by sorcery and song, as cold and indifferent to him as the light of a wandering star."
[4B-17] "You've made a mistake in coming here."
[4C-17] "But to know where he is, we need to know where he is from..."
[4D-17] "And to know that, we've got to begin elsewhere..."
[4E-17] "And not that long ago. A simple man he was, with a quick wit and a sharp tongue, an eye for the lasses and a talent for keeping one step ahead of the law, come to Houton to play his tunes and make his way."
[4F-17] "He found himself standing outside the The Drunken Rat, a public house owned by the Widow Mary MacRary. The Bard readied his instrument and prepared to ply his trade."
[50-17] "So it was the Bard obtained everything his heart had ever desired... at the expense of the rest of the world of course. Thus concludes the Bard's Tale. Finally the end... I thought I'd never be rid of him... never ask me to read this halfwit's story again"
[51-17] "The promise of love and riches, lost. The near destruction of the world as we know it. Death, misery and chaos. Under the weight of such trials most men would emerge changed, some for the better and some for the worse..."
[52-17] "...but for the Bard, things ended the same way they began."
[53-17] "Well my friend, we're back in business."
[54-17] "So the Bard decided to take the short and narrow road, otherwise known as the easy way out, to the nearest bar."
[55-17] "Who says the undead don't know how to party?"
[56-17] "With the plight of the world obviously far from his mind, which by all accounts, only has room for coin and cleavage, the Bard enjoyed his drinks with his newfound friends, that is until... well that is another story."
