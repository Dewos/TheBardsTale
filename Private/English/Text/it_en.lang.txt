[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[43-07] "Our hero having proven himself more than a match for the guardians of the tower was now sealed inside, perhaps entombed for the rest of his inevitably short life."
[44-07] "I'm going to live through this just to spite you."
[45-07] "Come no further. I am Mannanan the guardian of this tower, you are not welcome in this place. I give you one chance to turn back. You shall not pass."
[46-07] "That sounds eerily familiar. Look, even if I wanted to turn back... which I don't... there's no way out. I might as well move forward."
[47-07] "You have been warned."
[48-07] "You know not what you are getting yourself into fool of a Bard. Turn back now before it is too late!"
[49-07] "Not knowing what I'm getting myself into has been the latest trend for me. No point in thinking that's going to change.  In the spirit of things however, I'll give you one last chance to surrender to ME. How does that sound?"
[4A-07] "I cannot abandon my eternal vigil. You leave me no choice. To the Death!"
[4B-07] "You made it."
[4C-07] "Sorry I'm late. I had a bit of trouble with the weather. Hold on a minute. You're still a spirit!"
[4D-07] "Of course my love."
[4E-07] "But this is the third tower!"
[4F-07] "True my love."
[50-07] "But you're supposed to be here... I mean in the flesh."
[51-07] "No my love, I am imprisoned atop the tower in Dounby."
[52-07] "You said you'd be in the third tower."
[53-07] "No, I said you needed to put out the flames in three towers to set me free."
[54-07] "And I have."
[55-07] "My prison in the Dounby Tower could not be opened until all three flames were extinguished.  Now you can come to the final tower and rescue me... in the flesh.  Soft, warm, supple..."
[56-07] "All right, all right, just put a sock in it!  It's growing a little old... even for me.  Just tell me how many lands must I venture to before this so-called final tower?  How many Bodbs and instruments must I collect?  And how many more idiots must I converse with?"
[57-07] "Nothing more, just come to the tower."
[58-07] "I'll believe that if I live to see it. There is of course a slight problem.  The door to this tower has been sealed, and I have no way out."
[59-07] "I can help you. The magic that binds me grows weak thanks to your efforts. I was aware of Fionnaoch's plan to trap you and have been conserving my energies so that I could aid you this one final time."
[5A-07] "Your transportation to Dounby awaits."
[5B-07] "Hmmm... interesting.  Look, could you conjure up something that sticks to the ground?  A nice carriage perhaps."
[5C-07] "You'll be perfectly safe. I'll await your arrival at the top of the tower, I long for our first kiss."
[5D-07] "I'll tell you what... If you're not there you can kiss my..."
[5E-07] "Farewell."
[5F-07] "I hate people who have to be the ones to get the last word in."
[60-07] "I am shocked by the strife and suffering this beautiful soul hath endured. Indeed it hath gone on too long, and it will take the likes of us to win her freedom. We must set her free."
[61-07] "And so our brave Bard would soon mount the fiery beast and ride through turbulent skies, winging his way towards destiny and the..."
[AA-0B] "Ugghhhh... Excuse me... I get a little sick even thinking about flight."
[AB-0B] "Oh I give up... And so our Brave Bard mounted the fiery beast, hung on for dear life and tried to keep down his lunch."
