[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[50-05] "The Bard entered Finstown, where a modest reception and gentle folk awaited"
[51-05] "There he is!  The Bard is coming!"
[52-05] "Yes it's me! Your hero has arrived! Looks like my reputation has preceded me"
[53-05] "Fire!"
[54-05] "And stay out, nancy boy!"
[55-05] "Maybe he's runnin' home for a clean pair o' shorts!"
[56-05] "It was in fact painfully obvious to the Bard that his reputation had proceeded him."
[57-05] "And bravely did our Bard return to familiar Finstown."
[58-05] "The Bard soon got it through his head, along with half a dozen arrows, that maybe he needed to toughen up a bit before coming round here again."
[59-05] "Hurray! Hurray for the Bard!"
[5A-05] "If it isn't the Bard. I'm sure our leader Silkbeard will want to talk to you, he's in that large building across town, the one with most of its windows still intact."
[5B-05] "Ah, the sight of that dragon burning down the gates still brings a tear to my eyes."
[5C-05] "Are those villagers still outside?  Wish they'd hurry up and attack, we could all use a good brawl."
[5D-05] "This is the good life, if only uncle Hrafn could be here. Sigh. Ah well another drink to his name!"
[5E-05] "Hey what are you looking at? Move along now."
[5F-05] "Go find your own plunder!"
[60-05] "Surprisingly, the Bard found himself in the local tavern. There's a first time for everything I suppose. Trowie's Pub was once a quaint local hangout, but it much like the rest of the town had been overrun by Vikings."
[61-05] "I dunno what you've done, but the villagers don't seem to like you much. Come to think of it, neither do I."
[62-05] "Ah it's the Bard. A drink to your health Bard!"
[63-05] "zzzzzzz...."
[64-05] "It's a right pair of brass bollocks you've got, showin' your face around here."
[65-05] "Hold on, hold on, why the hostility? I've never even been to this town before... at least not that I can remember. In any case I've certainly done nothing to harm you."
[66-05] "As if you didn't know."
[67-05] "I don't."
[68-05] "Right. And next you'll be tellin' me it wasn't you that set the Orkney Dragon free."
[69-05] "Dragon?  What dragon?"
[6A-05] "D'you take me for a fool!? You think we don't know that you set the beast free to raze our city and let the Vikings come stormin' in afterwards."
[6B-05] "Oh is this that town? I do remember cracking open a big locked gate, but no one mentioned anything about a dragon."
[6C-05] "That's right. Play dumb. You'll get what's comin' to you."
[6D-05] "Well if that means riches and women I'm all for it, but it doesn't look like this town has either to offer now."
[6E-05] "Nobody to blame but yourself for that one. At least many of the villagers escaped and have been laying siege to the town, perhaps they'll make it in and rescue us eventually"
[6F-05] "I'm sure they will... I think I better be going now."
[70-05] "Yeah, go and don't come back."
[71-05] "Maybe I wasn't clear enough for you the first time, so let me put this in a way even the village idiot can understand. Get lost!"
[72-05] "Eeeek it's a rat! Oh somebody kill it! Kill it!"
[73-05] "All right, all right, steady on, the big scary rat is gone now."
[74-05] "Errr thanks Bard I um... not sure what happened there I... hey take this and don't tell anyone what you saw, ok?"
[75-05] "Not bad, my lips are sealed."
[76-05] "Welcome my friend. Take a look at my wares and I'm sure you'll find they're the finest materials from every corner of the globe. Only the best of the best is sold here."
[77-05] "That one? Pulled it out of a drunken Trow in Dounby. Cleaned up pretty nice. The dirk, not the Trow. That smelly bugger bled to death all over my best boots."
[78-05] "Nice choice, that. Lets you get close enough to hear their dyin' breath rattle out of 'em."
[79-05] "Here now. Got it off a southern dwarf; all I had to do was behead a couple of the King's Lawyers. Cheap at twice the price."
[7A-05] "Don't forget, it's especially good against bounders, rounders and blackguards; knaves and ne'er-do-wells, mountebanks, miscreants, rakes, rogues, scofflaws, scallywags, shysters of all stripes and scoundrels of the deepest dye."
[7B-05] "I can vow personally that this is the finest of flails. It nearly took my own life in the great battle of Hammerhill on the island of Sanday.  Fortunately Thor was with me that day and I ducked just in time. All proceeds for it go to the family of my good friend Kolskegg who was unlucky enough to be standing behind me."
[7C-05] "Thanks for your purchase. Kolskegg's family'll be greatful."
[7D-05] "This fine weapon was donated to me by a warrior who had no use for a two-hander after suffering a mishap in battle.  He did live to go home to his family, but I'm afraid he'll never clap again. Heard he became a juggler after that."
[7E-05] "Excellent choice!"
[7F-05] "I see you eyein' this bow. Belonged to a young man called himself the Chosen One, whatever the hell that means. Last I heard he ended up an appetizer for some redcaps, horrible way to go."
[80-05] "Good choice, hope you don't end up like that Chosen One fella."
[81-05] "Now this is a bow. Fell in love with it the moment I saw it, I did. The owner didn't want to sell it so I  had to trade him my kids for it! Well, a couple at least. Sure is a beauty."
[82-05] "If you ever see my kids, be sure to tell 'em how much you like the bow. It'd mean a lot."
[83-05] "Now this Elderwood Bow  is a rare find indeed. Had to stab a few fellows in the back to acquire it, ah those were good times."
[84-05] "Looks like your dreams are comin' true, now that you've got that artillery in your paws."
[85-05] "This is some of the finest armor you're likely to see."
[86-05] "Good choice on the armor.  Even comes with a guarantee for the life of the owner. Works too! I had to steal it before I killed the last owner."
[87-05] "That suit of mail is quite a beauty. It can make any warrior look good, even the dead one I took it from. If you can look good dead, that says a lot for what you're wearing."
[88-05] "You know, just holding it in your hands, you look better already."
[89-05] "Oh, now let me tell you about this armor. There was this warrior princess, see, and she an' me, we have ourselves this little game of cards. And soon enough it's my breeks against her chain, and guess who won? Damn near fainted when she peeled it off... ah those were the days."
[8A-05] "If you see that Princess, you tell her I'm ready for another game of cards whenever she wants!"
[8B-05] "This particular kite shield is as fine a piece of protection as I ever stripped off a dead knight. You just can't go wrong with quality like that."
[8C-05] "Good choice. I got most of the blood off, but you might want to check it, just to be sure. Oh, and some soap and water should take care of the smell."
[8D-05] "This targ shield was actually buried with an ancient warrior. Legend has it this warrior lived to be over 200 years old because the shield was so well made; it protected him from death itself."
[8E-05] "Sold! Now just three more and you'll have yourself the nicest set of wheels in all the land!"
[8F-05] "The Bard arrived at the headquarters of the viking leader Silkbeard. Being unsure of what type of reception awaited him within, our hero steeled himself for a confrontation."
[90-05] "Look who it is!"
[91-05] "Oh, hell. Time to start killing."
[92-05] "Gather round, you drunken sots!  The Bard's come at last!  A flagon of ale and a haunch of meat!  Hell, give him anything he wants! It's the least we can do after what you've done for us!"
[93-05] "And just what was that?"
[94-05] "What was that, he says! That was the Orkney Dragon you loosed on this damn' town! Months we'd been at it, hammering at the gates and slaughtering the townsfolk when we could get at 'em.  Then along comes your dragon, smashes the gate in one pass and puts half the city to the torch! It... it was... beautiful."
[95-05] "Hurrah! Three cheers for the Bard!"
[96-05] "No wonder the locals hate me."
[97-05] "Hate you!?  Hate you!?  They don't hate you, man!  They love you!"
[98-05] "They love me? What are you on about?"
[99-05] "Wait. No. Not love. Loathe! They loathe you! Despise you! They'll curse your name with every breath for a thousand years! What wouldn't I give for fame like that!"
[9A-05] "You can have it."
[9B-05] "That's no way for a death-dealing devil like you to talk!  And as long as you're here, go where you will, slaughter the local folk, and take what you want! It's the least we can do for such a horrible, murdering bastard as yourself!"
[9C-05] "Here now Bard, I owe you a lot but messin' with a man's treasure that's not proper."
[9D-05] "Just admiring your property, I've no mind to be making off with any of it.. well... Not for right now."
[9E-05] "Upon the edge of town was a makeshift prison camp, with crude ramshackle walls that held captive the once proud people of Finstown. These prisoners had little chance against the well armed Vikings, but the Bard could pick up a bit of goodwill if he helped them with their dilemma.  At this point, the Bard needed as much goodwill as he could muster."
[9F-05] "Help us! Help us!"
[A0-05] "Please free us from Silkbeard and his men!"
[A1-05] "It doth take a true man to fight and protect himself Bard, but that man doth improve ten fold when he puts himself to the hazard for others. Thou help the weak... thou help thyself.  Thou defend the innocent... thou defend thy manhood.  If I were thee..."
[A2-05] "Yeah, well, since you're not me, we'll end this little talk now."
[A3-05] "All stand back and hail your new hero!"
[A4-05] "You should feel fortunate we don't hail you with stones, since it was your actions that put us here. Nevertheless we need your help. Reinforcements are on the way in numbers greater than you can handle alone.  However, with your magic and our help, they can be defeated."
[A5-05] "No, I think not. All I need is vicious Vikings on one side of me and ungrateful stone-hailing villagers on the other.  I work alone."
[A6-05] "I'll open the gates, but if one stone hits my head you're going back in."
[A7-05] "A cold man you are leaving us here to die.  You'll only be colder when you're dead, which will be very soon."
[A8-05] "Maybe there's some good in you after all.  Free us and we'll fight at your side."
[A9-05] "So you've returned eh?  Have you come to your senses or are you just aimlessly wandering in circles."
[AA-05] "I thought I'd get a kick out of giving you all false hope.  Quite rewarding really."
[AB-05] "Normally I could take them on my own, but since I'm a little under the weather today, I'll set you free."
[AC-05] "Not as rewarding as seeing you slaughtered by the Vikings."
[AD-05] "You won't regret it.  Quickly open the gates and we'll prepare for the attack."
[AE-05] "You've a lot of nerve coming in here acting the hero after what you done!"
[AF-05] "We had a Bard of our own til the Vikings used him for target practice, he left this instrument behind, here, I suppose you could use it."
[B0-05] "I heard that some of the others escaped the initial attack and have gathered a small force outside town."
[B1-05] "Can you believe some idiot let the Orkney Dragon loose?"
[B2-05] "You're lucky we don't just string you up."
[B3-05] "I'm grateful to you for freeing us stranger, of course I don't hold a grudge the way most do."
[B4-05] "You're him, aren't you! You're the worthless chiseler my mom told me about!"
[B5-05] "Wait! Don't tell me! You must be the plug-ugly brat I've heard so much about."
[B6-05] "No one's ever all they're supposed to be. Take my advice, play it smart; get to know a man and then decide for yourself what kind of person he is."
[B7-05] "Ooooof!"
[B8-05] "Hahahahaha"
[B9-05] "Forget about their hearts and minds and mind your gonads. Some folks have the wonderful gift of seeing a man for what he really is."
[BA-05] "Whatever, chiseler."
[BB-05] "The Bard came across a building guarded by two burly Vikings.  Even the Bard could conclude that there must have been something of value in the building, especially now that I just said it out loud."
[BC-05] "Over here men! We have a challenge."
[BD-05] "Hello? Karl? Are you Guys All Right?"
[BE-05] "They can't talk right now. They're busy bleeding to death."
[BF-05] "Snorri? That you? Hey, open up! I bought some beer!"
[C0-05] "Come on in Bard... We've got more for ya!"
[C1-05] "Beer? Well, why didn't you say something sooner!"
[C2-05] "Where's the beer?  He killed Snorri and Karl!"
[C3-05] "Stand back! I'm going to gut him."
[C4-05] "Like hell! It was me that tricked him in here!"
[C5-05] "Tricked him!? He tricked you! You just wanted the beer!"
[C6-05] "Did not!"
[C7-05] "It's always beer with you."
[C8-05] "Is not! I like a nice dessert wine now and again, especially with a fruit dish..."
[C9-05] "You can both be quiet now!"
[CA-05] "So.... I let you roam my city and you repay me by freeing my hostages."
[CB-05] "So.... I let you roam my city and you repay me by stealing my loot and killing my men."
[CC-05] "It's my loot, Snotbeard. You and your little girls were just watching it for me."
[CD-05] "This little girl's about to gut you from grin to groin!"
[CE-05] "So.... You're the Bard, I don't understand you friend. First you free the Dragon so we can raze this town and now you come in here causing trouble?"
[CF-05] "I don't know anything about a dragon and I don't know you, but if you want to start some trouble I'd be more than happy to finish it."
[D0-05] "Any man, who doth take advantage of the weak and the innocent deserves a swift death!"
[D1-05] "I'll make sure your death is slow, be certain about that!"
[D2-05] "Have at thee villain!"
[D3-05] "I guess even during a flood some people are thankful for the rain. Thank you for doing the right thing and getting us out of this disaster."
[D4-05] "Let me see if I understand your reasoning.  If I ran you through, you'd thank me for removing the blade and ending the pain? Right? Interesting concept. I wish more people were as lacking in wit as you."
[D5-05] "If I had a piece of silver every time I was thanked for something I don't remember doing, I'd be a rich man."
[D6-05] "First you cause us to become enslaved by releasing the dragon and then act rude after I begrudgingly thank you, Do not darken our doorstep again. May the dark queen of the sith haunt your travels."
[D7-05] "As long as she's hot. Know what I mean?"
[D8-05] "And bravely did our Bard return to familiar Finstown..."
[D9-05] "Hey you! Open the gates!"
[DA-05] "Haven't you done enough damage already!?"
[DB-05] "I saved you from the vikings, old fool!"
[DC-05] "Saved us! You loosed the dragon on us!"
[DD-05] "For the last time... All right look.  Maybe, once, a long time ago I might've broken the seal on this gate and this hellish dragon got loose. But I swear I didn't know there was a dragon inside and even if I did I never saw him."
[DE-05] "Hah! You admit it!  It was you!"
[DF-05] "Maybe. Now, are you going to let me in or not?"
[E0-05] "Not."
[E1-05] "And bravely did our Bard retreat from familiar Finstown, never to return. Thankfully."
[30-0A] "Look Karl, it's the Bard."
[31-0A] "I thought he'd be taller."
[32-0A] "Best be on your way Bard, you're not allowed in here."
[33-0A] "Don't make us hurt you."
[71-0A] "I'm impressed, you fight well.  Maybe the release of the dragon was more than blind luck."
[72-0A] "Spoken like a Viking!  It's a shame I'm going to have to gut you."
[73-0A] "I like the way you think! It'll ease my conscience if I buy you a drink to grease your gullet, before I spread it about my fair town."
[74-0A] "Ah that was refreshing! Let's continue where we left off."
[75-0A] "Blind luck? It was blind luck that I stumbled across the world's most dimwitted Viking. Did your mother drop you on your head as a child?"
[76-0A] "To tell you the truth I was drunk."
[77-0A] "Likewise. Do you want to down a quick ale, before your untimely death?"
[3F-0B] "You have received the Mantle of Ossian"
[40-0B] "You have received Finn's Lute"
[41-0B] "You have received 175 Silver"
[4B-0B] "Trowie's Pub"
[4C-0B] "Stay back! Don't make us kill you!"
[54-0B] "I carry a fine collection of armor. Even the cowardly will stand firm in any of these well-crafted suits."
[55-0B] "When it comes to the true warrior, it's hand to hand weaponry that wins the day. All of these weapons would make even the most bloody thirsty viking proud."
[56-0B] "Bows. Not the most honorable of weapons, but a great way to catch the attention of a spineless villain making a hasty retreat."
[57-0B] "Welcome friend.  How can I help your cause?"
[B6-0B] "With pleasure."
[B7-0B] "It's really going to be a shame to have to kill you."
[B8-0B] "I'll tell you what I'll do for you..."
[B9-0B] "...I'll take your head when I'm done and mount it on a long pole..."
[BA-0B] "...you'll serve as my banner! Talk about being immortalized!"
[BB-0B] "Don't say I never did anything for you! Barkeep another round!"
[ED-0C] "All items obtained at great personal risk, feel free to browse."
[EE-0C] "A shame that is."
[F0-0C] "I'm fresh out of plunder."
[F1-0C] "You're after something rare and special eh?"
[F3-0C] "You've been good with your donations. I've a gift for you."
[77-0E] "What the hell do you want?"
[78-0E] "What?"
[79-0E] "One of the drinks these vikings brought with them. Comes from one of their villages along the coast. I hear it's decent but I haven't tried it."
[7A-0E] "A very tasty brew but not for the faint of heart. It's the pride and joy of Finstown, made from an old family recipe by a man who lived right next door to this very pub. Of course he had to flee with just about everyone else thanks to a certain Bard letting in that horde of vikings."
[7B-0E] "That's an aptly named drink. I don't know what Silkbeard uses in brewing it and quite frankly I don't want to know!"
[7C-0E] "An old favorite here in Finstown, I was hoping to order more but the fella that brews it was run out of Houton for some reason."
[7D-0E] "Good riddance."
[7E-0E] "I hope you choke on it."
[7F-0E] "Next time, take your business elsewhere."
[89-0E] "So you're the one responsible for all this death and destruction. Ah well... Forgive and forget is my motto. Care to make a donation and buy a little forgiveness."
[23-13] "Viking Song"
[26-13] "Good riddance to you!"
[27-13] "We'll never forgive you Bard!"
[28-13] "Don't ever come back to Finstown!"
[29-13] "Don't think this means we're letting you off the hook."
[BE-13] "Come gather 'round all ye bastards, and raise up a cup to this arse-turd.  He came and freed the fires of hell, and let 'im run loose over hill and dell.  Here's to the Bard and his scab of a brain. Here's to the Dragon and all it has slain. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame, and it's ours for the taking, and you get the fame. We tortured some townsfolk, it's true, and pounded, but couldn't break through. With all his might the dragon took flight and burned the town down to a ball-bag of shite.  Here's to the Bard and his knob of a head.  Here's to the Orkney, the smoke, and the dead.  The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame, and it's ours for the taking, and you get the fame.  Here's to the Bard and a pullin' me plum.  Here's to the Beast and the rest of you scum.  The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame, and it's ours for the taking, though you get the fame."
