[01-00] "Here lies Erik the Viking, He fights in Valhalla now, Much to his liking."
[E2-00] "Quest Complete!"
[EA-05] "It's true then."
[EB-05] "I don't know what game he plays by coming here but he will regret it. Allow him to pass through the northern gate unmolested. When he's inside the city we will strike."
[D5-06] "He eluded our traps?"
[D6-06] "He's stronger than anticipated master."
[D7-06] "You men go to the tower. Once he's inside seal the doors, even should he defeat Mannanan that tower will become his tomb."
[D8-06] "Yes my lord."
[D9-06] "Mackay I have a special task for you, this Bard seems more than a match for the men."
[DA-06] "He is indeed master, however if we're given another chance I'm sure..."
[DB-06] "We're running out of chances, you must face him. Intercept him before he reaches the tower... take my pet with you to ensure that he does not survive."
[DC-06] "He doesn't stand a chance."
[60-07] "I am shocked by the strife and suffering this beautiful soul hath endured. Indeed it hath gone on too long, and it will take the likes of us to win her freedom. We must set her free."
[62-07] "Cathbad is faring poorly in his efforts. This... Bard has already evaded one of his traps and has reached the mountain tower alive. Lugh should be able to handle him but take some of the Brothers and ensure he does not leave the tower alive."
[63-07] "Yes my lord."
[64-07] "See that you don't fail. Use any means necessary to stop him. You know what's at stake."
[65-07] "We will do as you command."
[CA-08] "As the Bard drew closer to the Tower in the forest, a scene of great concern to him would play itself out atop another tower, in the city of Dounby, many leagues away..."
[CB-08] "Cathbad, Gather the brothers. Someone is nearing the first tower."
[CC-08] "At once sir."
[CD-08] "Mackay... wake my... pet."
[CE-08] "Yes my lord Fionnaoch."
[F1-08] "It had come to this, at last. One man on his own. A poet and a rogue, with no friends to speak of, no one to mourn his passing should it come to that. Even those beside him are no more boon companions than bondservants, summoned by sorcery and song, as cold and indifferent to him as the light of a wandering star."
[F2-08] "But to know where he is, and what may yet come to pass, we need to know who he is and where he's from..."
[F3-08] "And to know that, we've got to begin elsewhere...."
[F4-08] "I am not going through all of that again!  Can we please just get on with it?"
[F5-08] "Er, Sorry... Got caught up in the moment...As you were..."
[F6-08] "You've made a mistake coming here Bard. You have no chance to make it past me, turn around and leave."
[F7-08] "If I have no chance then why are you offering me a way out? Are you scared without your big beastie backing you up?"
[F8-08] "This time I'll take care of you myself Bard."
[F9-08] "We finally meet."
[FA-08] "Finally?  Do I know you?"
[FB-08] "No, but I know you... and might I say..."
[FC-08] "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  I've been through all this before.  You're not getting by me, I will kill you where you stand. You're an idiot.  Blah, blah, blah.  I've heard it all before. Can we just skip that part and get right down to it?"
[FD-08] "I agree, the sooner you are dead the better."
[FE-08] "Heard that one before too."
[FF-08] "My Champion, at last I can look upon your face."
[00-09] "You're even more beautiful in person m'lady. One moment, and I shall free you from your prison."
[01-09] "You are such a fool, Bard."
[02-09] "And may I know the name of the man who thinks me a fool?"
[03-09] "Don't listen to him, he's the one who's been trying to kill you."
[04-09] "Yeah, I've noticed."
[05-09] "My duty is to stop any man who threatens to unleash evil upon the land, and you are that man."
[06-09] "I've been fighting this evil to set the princess free so she can send you and all of your demonic little friends back to hell where you came from."
[07-09] "A place she's very familiar with since that is where she's from. She's the ruler of these fiends you speak of, she is from the very bowels of hell itself!"
[08-09] "I know she's a little bossy, but no reason to get rude."
[09-09] "He lies!  Kill the bastard!"
[0A-09] "You're not helping your case here. Are you insinuating the princess has something to do with everything that's been going wrong in the world?"
[0B-09] "Your betrothed there is the direct cause of it all!"
[0C-09] "Now you've gone too far.  She's not my betrothed!"
[0D-09] "My love, don't you see what he's doing?  This is his last desperate attempt to stop you from setting me free. The minions he's set upon you have failed, so he's resorting to telling you desperate lies. Please don't let him confuse you, he's the one behind all of the evil that assails the land."
[0E-09] "I will fight you if I must, but she is the enemy, not I.  She has been playing you for the fool."
[0F-09] "I'm not stupid. There's no way this woman is the root of all evil.  I mean, look how hot she is, for crying out loud."
[10-09] "You have eyes, yet you do not see. You have ears, yet you do not hear.  You have a brain, but it is located in your..."
[11-09] "Get to the point please."
[12-09] "Caleigh has been held captive here since the last time she attempted to cover the land in darkness, a thousand years ago.  It took the power of four mighty wizards to defeat her and entrap her here, ensuring that her reign of terror was ended. All this time she has been looking for a man, a \"chosen one\" if you will, to set her free so she can rule again. I'm afraid you've been only a pawn in her game... one she will surely dispose of once set free."
[13-09] "This is why I hate dating."
[14-09] "My darling, he speaks half-truths. I was imprisoned here, not by wizards, but by four demonic warlords. You have seen some of them and vanquished them yourself. It was I who defeated their armies although I was weakened in doing so. After the battle they trapped me here while they rebuilt their forces. They will rule this land forever unless you kill him and set me free."
[15-09] "Listen... I think I need to sleep on this."
[16-09] "You must choose now my friend, time is running out."
[17-09] "Look inside your heart love. Set me free."
[18-09] "The time had come. The Bard was forced to choose, and he knew that he had better choose wisely."
[19-09] "If thou were to ask for mine opinion, and thou would be most wise to do so for I am an excellent judge of character. It is plain to me who is the weak and defenseless victim here and who is the blackguard wishing to imprison her. Slay yon vile knave and save thy lovely damsel, I am certain this is the correct course of action."
[1A-09] "Yes, actually, if I look deep into my heart, I can only come to one logical conclusion."
[1B-09] "What is that my love?"
[1C-09] "Never trust a woman."
[1D-09] "What?"
[1E-09] "Wouldn't you know it?  There's always an angle, isn't there?  Give me money... plow the fields... let me out of my magical prison to enslave all of humanity!  And I fell for it... again!"
[1F-09] "Happens to the best of us."
[20-09] "But you and I, we're meant to be..."
[21-09] "Oh give it up! You've been pluckin' my strings from the get go."
[22-09] "And you've been royally plucked."
[23-09] "No more. You know, one minute this beautiful woman appears in a puff of smoke and a flash of light, and the next she turns out to be some sort of evil hellspawn! How do I always miss the subtle signs? Well, let me tell ya, this whole thing, it's over!"
[24-09] "Is there nothing I can say to change your mind?"
[25-09] "There's not even anything you can do to change my mind."
[26-09] "Not even a kiss?"
[27-09] "What?"
[28-09] "You know, a kiss. A simple kiss. It is the only way I can show you how I truly feel."
[29-09] "Oh...well...uhh..."
[2A-09] "Be careful Bard."
[2B-09] "What the hell... I've come all this way.  I mean... a kiss never killed anyone, right?"
[2C-09] "Foolish mortal, you had the chance to rule at my side and live forever... but now you shall die like the dog that you are."
[2D-09] "I tried to warn you."
[2E-09] "Is it me, or is she still hot?"
[2F-09] "Prepare to experience excruciating pain that will last an eternity."
[30-09] "I've already told you... The relationship is off."
[31-09] "I must say that was quite impressive."
[32-09] "You gotta show them who's boss or they'll just walk all over you."
[33-09] "Now that she's gone, things will return to normal. Crops will grow and the dead will remain in their graves. You came very close to destroying life as we know it, but you've redeemed yourself."
[34-09] "Just show me the way out of this damn tower."
[35-09] "Well my friend, we're back in business."
[36-09] "The promise of love and riches, lost. The near destruction of the world as we know it. Death, misery and chaos. Under the weight of such trials most men would emerge changed, some for the better and some for the worse..."
[37-09] "The heart is just a muscle... Nothing more, nothing less."
[38-09] "Perhaps I underestimated you."
[39-09] "Those who are foolish enough to believe the heart is in anyway connected with love, whatever the hell that is, are living in a fantasy world, my friend."
[3A-09] "Then again, I may have been right all along."
[3B-09] "The heart just pumps blood where it needs to go, and that's all that matters to me... if you catch my drift."
[3C-09] "Perhaps I was right all along."
[3D-09] "And after seeing Caleigh and hearing your story..."
[3E-09] "You mean the truth..."
[3F-09] "Well, I must say I am torn. Normally in a situation like this, I'd flip a coin."
[40-09] "I have a coin right here."
[41-09] "But, since she's hot, and you're not... and since she has all the coins I'll ever need... then why waste my time. Sorry my friend, but your story just doesn't wash, she's a thousand years old? Please!"
[42-09] "I knew I could count on you my love."
[43-09] "If that heart of yours pumped some blood to your other head, you'd see what a catastrophic choice you've made."
[44-09] "What, are you blind?  Look at her!"
[45-09] "If you side with Caleigh, this land will be doomed to darkness forever."
[46-09] "I do my best work in the dark."
[47-09] "You really are an idiot. Your foolishness will stop right here... Prepare to die."
[48-09] "Very well. Hold on princess, I'll be back in a minute... maybe two."
[49-09] "Watching you fight... my blood boils for you. You've done it, you've set me free."
[4A-09] "Enough with the words princess."
[4B-09] "Before we embrace, I must take my true form."
[4C-09] "I thought that didn't happen until after ten years of marriage."
[4D-09] "Oh you're going to like this."
[4E-09] "Oh crap! That dead guy was right! You are the Queen of Darkness!"
[4F-09] "Well of course, but does it really matter?"
[50-09] "How does it feel to be at the side of the ruler of the underworld?"
[51-09] "Every woman I was ever involved with ended up being the woman from hell.  Now I have the real thing. Could be fun."
[52-09] "So it was the Bard obtained everything his heart had ever desired... at the expense of the rest of the world of course. Thus concludes the Bard's Tale. Finally the end... I thought I'd never be rid of him... never ask me to read this halfwit's story again."
[53-09] "All right... I've made my choice"
[54-09] "Well it's about bloody time."
[55-09] "Don't get too excited, I didn't choose you."
[56-09] "You choose Caleigh?"
[57-09] "I didn't say that either."
[58-09] "Tell us my champion, whom do you choose?"
[59-09] "A very logical choice... Me."
[5A-09] "You chose you?"
[5B-09] "Exactly."
[5C-09] "What the hell does that mean?  What kind of choice is that?"
[5D-09] "As far as I'm concerned?  An excellent one."
[5E-09] "But what about our future?"
[5F-09] "Well let's look into our crystal ball, shall we?  If I fight either one of you, I could be dead. If I kill one of you, and it's the wrong one, I either end up in hell on earth or in a relationship from hell... literally. So fighting is really a no-win situation."
[60-09] "Even if that fighting can save life as we know it?"
[61-09] "I'll let you two figure that out. In the mean time, these undead aren't a bad lot really."
[62-09] "This is unacceptable you miserable little rat. You will free me, and you will free me now!"
[63-09] "I will rule this land and you will be at my side!"
[64-09] "There's a twist.  I'm intrigued... and oddly aroused... But uh, I'm afraid I still choose to walk away.  Good luck, and oh don't forget to write."
[65-09] "Come back here you disloyal coward and bow before your queen!"
[66-09] "Come back here you weak minded fool and kill your queen!"
[67-09] "You two have serious control issues, you realize that don't you?"
[68-09] "Who says the undead don't know how to party?"
[69-09] "So... Do you die here often?"
[6A-09] "So the Bard decided to take the short and narrow road, otherwise known as the easy way out, to the nearest bar. With the plight of the world obviously far from his mind, which by all accounts, only has room for coin and cleavage, the Bard enjoyed his drinks with his newfound friends, that is until... well that is another story."
[BE-0B] "...but the Bard, for the Bard things ended the same way they began."
[BF-0B] "Well my friend, we're back in business."
[C1-0B] "Yes my lord, we have kept the northern passes under watch as you commanded. He will enter the city soon."
[3F-0D] "Even now you find ways to reach your servants. This new suitor of yours will fare no better than the others."
[40-0D] "Awaken Herne."
[41-0D] "Fionnaoch. Why do you disturb my vigil?"
[42-0D] "The woman has managed to send messages to her followers again. One of them approaches your tower hoping to free her."
[43-0D] "After all this time still she is strong."
[44-0D] "Deal with this intruder. I'm sending my men to aid you. I needn't remind you of the consequences should you fail."
[45-0D] "I will stop him."
[46-0D] "The brothers are assembling my Lord. We await your instructions."
[47-0D] "Take the men to Herne's tower, I've promised him our aid. Once you've done this, head to the mountains. If all else fails you must stop him there."
[48-0D] "It will be my pleasure master."
[49-0D] "As the Bard strove to complete his quest and rescue the Princess, the enemy grew ever more desperate to put an end to his efforts."
[4A-0D] "Lugh."
[4B-0D] "Herne has fallen."
[4C-0D] "I would disturb your vigil for no other reason."
[4D-0D] "I always thought he was soft. So this man that defeated Herne, he's coming to pay me a visit next?"
[4E-0D] "He's almost there now."
[4F-0D] "It's been a long time since I've had a challenge, this should be amusing."
[50-0D] "Do not underestimate this man Lugh. He is... formidable."
[51-0D] "As formidable as me? I doubt that."
[52-0D] "As unlikely as that possibility may be, I warn you once again to use caution. I'm sending some of my servants to aid you in case..."
[53-0D] "Don't insult me. I'll take care of this problem and I will do it without your aid. I'll speak to you again once he's dead."
[54-0D] "Insufferable man."
[55-0D] "Still, such men have their uses do they not Fionnaoch?"
[56-0D] "I was wondering when you'd regain consciousness. I was rather hoping I'd be spared your company for a while longer."
[57-0D] "You haven't changed much, you never did have anything resembling manners. My champion is going to free me Fionnaoch, I've finally found the right man."
[58-0D] "That remains to be seen."
[59-0D] "If he's too much for your men perhaps you should go see to him personally."
[5A-0D] "Silence."
[5B-0D] "Or can it be that you must maintain proximity to this prison you have me in? That you're using much of your own power to keep me locked away? Do you have enough power left to defeat the Bard when he reaches you? I wonder..."
[5C-0D] "Enough!"
[5D-0D] "I've more than enough power to deal with both of you \"princess\". See that you remember this."
[5E-0D] "What is this Bard of yours trying to accomplish woman? Why is he coming to my city? He can't hope to free you yet, the island tower still stands."
[5F-0D] "I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about \"lord\" Fionnaoch."
[60-0D] "He will fail Caleigh and when he does I will reinforce the strength of your bonds a thousand times over. You will never be free."
[61-0D] "With the Isle Tower close at hand the long journey of the Bard was drawing to a close. Leagues away and unbeknownst to our hero a somewhat familiar scene was being played out."
[62-0D] "At every turn he foils my plans! First Cathbad and then my Pet! What kind of a monster have you enlisted against me Caleigh? Who is this Bard? Where did you find him?"
[63-0D] "He's nobody Fionnaoch. A wanderer, a simple man enlisted in a noble cause, fighting to overthrow a tyrant. It's a familiar story isn't it?"
[64-0D] "Do not mock me. An average man you say? I think not. He leaves a trail of mayhem and destruction in his wake, no ordinary man could have struck down Herne and then Lugh. Still, you give me an interesting notion."
[65-0D] "Which is?"
[66-0D] "You'll find out when he's here. I begin to suspect that he might make it this far."
[67-0D] "Admitting defeat? That's unlike you."
[68-0D] "I admit only the possibility that he may reach this tower alive. Then of course he'll have me to deal with."
[69-0D] "Mannanan."
[6A-0D] "I sense change in the winds Fionnaoch. What is happening?"
[6B-0D] "Herne and Lugh have fallen. Only you and I stand between Caleigh and her freedom."
[6C-0D] "Then we must stand firm."
[6D-0D] "As you say. Mannanan, this man that approaches your tower, he is powerful."
[6E-0D] "A single man has undone both Herne and Lugh?"
[6F-0D] "Indeed he has. Much is riding on your ability to stop him."
[70-0D] "If I should fail, you will avenge me."
[71-0D] "I will."
[72-0D] "Is that an emotion other than anger I hear in your voice Fionnaoch?"
[73-0D] "You'd be surprised what the years can do to a man."
[31-12] "Well, I'd have to go with the lass fer sure. I mean it's not everyday you run into a lady with her... ummm attributes."
[32-12] "Have you not seen enough to know she's been using you? Think of all the others she's tricked into trying to rescue her, all those Chosen Ones. And all dead."
[33-12] "Me think pretty lady is nice. Man is big ugly nasty who tried to hurt friends. I crush him if you say so Bard friend."
[34-12] "I know a little something about how appearances can be deceiving and there's some major deception happening here. It doesn't all add up Bard. I think the Druid there is telling the truth"
[35-12] "This druid has an ill look about him for sure. As far as I know he's the only one who's tried to kill you, I think the choice is obvious."
[36-12] "A highborn Lady would not stoop to deception. This Druid however is a peasant with little honor, much like yourself. I fear he is not to be trusted."
[37-12] "Well it sure is a difficult choice... on one hand the Druid has tried to kill you but on the other hand the Lady seems a little too good to be true. I don't know, whatever you decide I'm sure it'll be the right choice!"
[38-12] "I'm not usually one to side with a big fella like that but what he says does make sense. I mean I can't see why a real princess would ever be interested in the likes of you."
[39-12] ""
[3A-12] "Errr... right ok then."
[3B-12] "I do seem to remember something about an evil queen bein' bandied about in my younger and more tangible days. Could be this Caleigh here is that same Lady. I'd be careful with her if I was you."
[3C-12] "A difficult choice eh maestro? Listen to what your heart tells you and you can't go wrong. Me, I don't see the appeal in the princess over there... that Druid however tall, dark, and mysterious... I'd go for him. I'd go with him for sure."

Its time to face your own reality.  There's one thing we can say with certainty.  That it's you that has been chosen, even though you've been opposing.  I guess you were the only nominee.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  The prophecy is never coming true.  In a pickle you'll be stuck, like a chicken you will cluck.  Oh, It's bad luck to be you.  We've come to the end of our tale.  We've sung a lot and drank up all the ale.  You are pretty much a fraud, and for that we do applaud.  Although we all were hoping you would fail.  Oh, it's bad luck to be you.  Don't think for just a second it's not true.  When your life is run amuck you will see that you're the schmuck.  Oh, it's bad luck to be, really bad luck to be, nobody could disagree, it's a freakin' guarantee, it's bad luck to be you!  Diddly doo."
